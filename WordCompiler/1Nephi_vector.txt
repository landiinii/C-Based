I
nephi
having
been
born
of
goodly
parents
therefore
I
was
taught
somewhat
in
all
the
learning
of
my
father
and
having
seen
many
afflictions
in
the
course
of
my
days
nevertheless
having
been
highly
favored
of
the
lord
in
all
my
days
yea
having
had
a
great
knowledge
of
the
goodness
and
the
mysteries
of
god
therefore
I
make
a
record
of
my
proceedings
in
my
days
yea
I
make
a
record
in
the
language
of
my
father
which
consists
of
the
learning
of
the
jews
and
the
language
of
the
egyptians
and
I
know
that
the
record
which
I
make
is
true
and
I
make
it
with
mine
own
hand
and
I
make
it
according
to
my
knowledge
for
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah
my
father
lehi
having
dwelt
at
jerusalem
in
all
his
days
and
in
that
same
year
there
came
many
prophets
prophesying
unto
the
people
that
they
must
repent
or
the
great
city
jerusalem
must
be
destroyed
wherefore
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
lehi
as
he
went
forth
prayed
unto
the
lord
yea
even
with
all
his
heart
in
behalf
of
his
people
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
prayed
unto
the
lord
there
came
a
pillar
of
fire
and
dwelt
upon
a
rock
before
him
and
he
saw
and
heard
much
and
because
of
the
things
which
he
saw
and
heard
he
did
quake
and
tremble
exceedingly
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
returned
to
his
own
house
at
jerusalem
and
he
cast
himself
upon
his
bed
being
overcome
with
the
spirit
and
the
things
which
he
had
seen
and
being
thus
overcome
with
the
spirit
he
was
carried
away
in
a
vision
even
that
he
saw
the
heavens
open
and
he
thought
he
saw
god
sitting
upon
his
throne
surrounded
with
numberless
concourses
of
angels
in
the
attitude
of
singing
and
praising
their
god
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
saw
one
descending
out
of
the
midst
of
heaven
and
he
beheld
that
his
luster
was
above
that
of
the
sun
at
noonday
and
he
also
saw
twelve
others
following
him
and
their
brightness
did
exceed
that
of
the
stars
in
the
firmament
and
they
came
down
and
went
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
first
came
and
stood
before
my
father
and
gave
unto
him
a
book
and
bade
him
that
he
should
read
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
he
read
he
was
filled
with
the
spirit
of
the
lord
and
he
read
saying
wo
wo
unto
jerusalem
for
I
have
seen
thine
abominations
yea
and
many
things
did
my
father
read
concerning
jerusalemthat
it
should
be
destroyed
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
many
should
perish
by
the
sword
and
many
should
be
carried
away
captive
into
babylon
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
read
and
seen
many
great
and
marvelous
things
he
did
exclaim
many
things
unto
the
lord
such
as
great
and
marvelous
are
thy
works
o
lord
god
almighty
thy
throne
is
high
in
the
heavens
and
thy
power
and
goodness
and
mercy
are
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
and
because
thou
art
merciful
thou
wilt
not
suffer
those
who
come
unto
thee
that
they
shall
perish
and
after
this
manner
was
the
language
of
my
father
in
the
praising
of
his
god
for
his
soul
did
rejoice
and
his
whole
heart
was
filled
because
of
the
things
which
he
had
seen
yea
which
the
lord
had
shown
unto
him
and
now
I
nephi
do
not
make
a
full
account
of
the
things
which
my
father
hath
written
for
he
hath
written
many
things
which
he
saw
in
visions
and
in
dreams
and
he
also
hath
written
many
things
which
he
prophesied
and
spake
unto
his
children
of
which
I
shall
not
make
a
full
account
but
I
shall
make
an
account
of
my
proceedings
in
my
days
behold
I
make
an
abridgment
of
the
record
of
my
father
upon
plates
which
I
have
made
with
mine
own
hands
wherefore
after
I
have
abridged
the
record
of
my
father
then
will
I
make
an
account
of
mine
own
life
therefore
I
would
that
ye
should
know
that
after
the
lord
had
shown
so
many
marvelous
things
unto
my
father
lehi
yea
concerning
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
behold
he
went
forth
among
the
people
and
began
to
prophesy
and
to
declare
unto
them
concerning
the
things
which
he
had
both
seen
and
heard
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
jews
did
mock
him
because
of
the
things
which
he
testified
of
them
for
he
truly
testified
of
their
wickedness
and
their
abominations
and
he
testified
that
the
things
which
he
saw
and
heard
and
also
the
things
which
he
read
in
the
book
manifested
plainly
of
the
coming
of
the
messiah
and
also
the
redemption
of
the
world
and
when
the
jews
heard
these
things
they
were
angry
with
him
yea
even
as
with
the
prophets
of
old
whom
they
had
cast
out
and
stoned
and
slain
and
they
also
sought
his
life
that
they
might
take
it
away
but
behold
I
nephi
will
show
unto
you
that
the
tender
mercies
of
the
lord
are
over
all
those
whom
he
hath
chosen
because
of
their
faith
to
make
them
mighty
even
unto
the
power
of
deliverance
for
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
my
father
yea
even
in
a
dream
and
said
unto
him
blessed
art
thou
lehi
because
of
the
things
which
thou
hast
done
and
because
thou
hast
been
faithful
and
declared
unto
this
people
the
things
which
I
commanded
thee
behold
they
seek
to
take
away
thy
life
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
commanded
my
father
even
in
a
dream
that
he
should
take
his
family
and
depart
into
the
wilderness
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
obedient
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
wherefore
he
did
as
the
lord
commanded
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
departed
into
the
wilderness
and
he
left
his
house
and
the
land
of
his
inheritance
and
his
gold
and
his
silver
and
his
precious
things
and
took
nothing
with
him
save
it
were
his
family
and
provisions
and
tents
and
departed
into
the
wilderness
and
he
came
down
by
the
borders
near
the
shore
of
the
red
sea
and
he
traveled
in
the
wilderness
in
the
borders
which
are
nearer
the
red
sea
and
he
did
travel
in
the
wilderness
with
his
family
which
consisted
of
my
mother
sariah
and
my
elder
brothers
who
were
laman
lemuel
and
sam
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
traveled
three
days
in
the
wilderness
he
pitched
his
tent
in
a
valley
by
the
side
of
a
river
of
water
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
built
an
altar
of
stones
and
made
an
offering
unto
the
lord
and
gave
thanks
unto
the
lord
our
god
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
called
the
name
of
the
river
laman
and
it
emptied
into
the
red
sea
and
the
valley
was
in
the
borders
near
the
mouth
thereof
and
when
my
father
saw
that
the
waters
of
the
river
emptied
into
the
fountain
of
the
red
sea
he
spake
unto
laman
saying
o
that
thou
mightest
be
like
unto
this
river
continually
running
into
the
fountain
of
all
righteousness
and
he
also
spake
unto
lemuel
o
that
thou
mightest
be
like
unto
this
valley
firm
and
steadfast
and
immovable
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
lord
now
this
he
spake
because
of
the
stiffneckedness
of
laman
and
lemuel
for
behold
they
did
murmur
in
many
things
against
their
father
because
he
was
a
visionary
man
and
had
led
them
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
to
leave
the
land
of
their
inheritance
and
their
gold
and
their
silver
and
their
precious
things
to
perish
in
the
wilderness
and
this
they
said
he
had
done
because
of
the
foolish
imaginations
of
his
heart
and
thus
laman
and
lemuel
being
the
eldest
did
murmur
against
their
father
and
they
did
murmur
because
they
knew
not
the
dealings
of
that
god
who
had
created
them
neither
did
they
believe
that
jerusalem
that
great
city
could
be
destroyed
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
and
they
were
like
unto
the
jews
who
were
at
jerusalem
who
sought
to
take
away
the
life
of
my
father
and
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
did
speak
unto
them
in
the
valley
of
lemuel
with
power
being
filled
with
the
spirit
until
their
frames
did
shake
before
him
and
he
did
confound
them
that
they
durst
not
utter
against
him
wherefore
they
did
as
he
commanded
them
and
my
father
dwelt
in
a
tent
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
being
exceedingly
young
nevertheless
being
large
in
stature
and
also
having
great
desires
to
know
of
the
mysteries
of
god
wherefore
I
did
cry
unto
the
lord
and
behold
he
did
visit
me
and
did
soften
my
heart
that
I
did
believe
all
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
my
father
wherefore
I
did
not
rebel
against
him
like
unto
my
brothers
and
I
spake
unto
sam
making
known
unto
him
the
things
which
the
lord
had
manifested
unto
me
by
his
holy
spirit
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
believed
in
my
words
but
behold
laman
and
lemuel
would
not
hearken
unto
my
words
and
being
grieved
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
I
cried
unto
the
lord
for
them
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
blessed
art
thou
nephi
because
of
thy
faith
for
thou
hast
sought
me
diligently
with
lowliness
of
heart
and
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
prosper
and
shall
be
led
to
a
land
of
promise
yea
even
a
land
which
I
have
prepared
for
you
yea
a
land
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands
and
inasmuch
as
thy
brethren
shall
rebel
against
thee
they
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
inasmuch
as
thou
shalt
keep
my
commandments
thou
shalt
be
made
a
ruler
and
a
teacher
over
thy
brethren
for
behold
in
that
day
that
they
shall
rebel
against
me
I
will
curse
them
even
with
a
sore
curse
and
they
shall
have
no
power
over
thy
seed
except
they
shall
rebel
against
me
also
and
if
it
so
be
that
they
rebel
against
me
they
shall
be
a
scourge
unto
thy
seed
to
stir
them
up
in
the
ways
of
remembrance
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
returned
from
speaking
with
the
lord
to
the
tent
of
my
father
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
I
have
dreamed
a
dream
in
the
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
that
thou
and
thy
brethren
shall
return
to
jerusalem
for
behold
laban
hath
the
record
of
the
jews
and
also
a
genealogy
of
my
forefathers
and
they
are
engraven
upon
plates
of
brass
wherefore
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
that
thou
and
thy
brothers
should
go
unto
the
house
of
laban
and
seek
the
records
and
bring
them
down
hither
into
the
wilderness
and
now
behold
thy
brothers
murmur
saying
it
is
a
hard
thing
which
I
have
required
of
them
but
behold
I
have
not
required
it
of
them
but
it
is
a
commandment
of
the
lord
therefore
go
my
son
and
thou
shalt
be
favored
of
the
lord
because
thou
hast
not
murmured
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
said
unto
my
father
I
will
go
and
do
the
things
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
for
I
know
that
the
lord
giveth
no
commandments
unto
the
children
of
men
save
he
shall
prepare
a
way
for
them
that
they
may
accomplish
the
thing
which
he
commandeth
them
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
heard
these
words
he
was
exceedingly
glad
for
he
knew
that
I
had
been
blessed
of
the
lord
and
I
nephi
and
my
brethren
took
our
journey
in
the
wilderness
with
our
tents
to
go
up
to
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
we
had
gone
up
to
the
land
of
jerusalem
I
and
my
brethren
did
consult
one
with
another
and
we
cast
lotswho
of
us
should
go
in
unto
the
house
of
laban
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lot
fell
upon
laman
and
laman
went
in
unto
the
house
of
laban
and
he
talked
with
him
as
he
sat
in
his
house
and
he
desired
of
laban
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
which
contained
the
genealogy
of
my
father
and
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
laban
was
angry
and
thrust
him
out
from
his
presence
and
he
would
not
that
he
should
have
the
records
wherefore
he
said
unto
him
behold
thou
art
a
robber
and
I
will
slay
thee
but
laman
fled
out
of
his
presence
and
told
the
things
which
laban
had
done
unto
us
and
we
began
to
be
exceedingly
sorrowful
and
my
brethren
were
about
to
return
unto
my
father
in
the
wilderness
but
behold
I
said
unto
them
that
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
we
live
we
will
not
go
down
unto
our
father
in
the
wilderness
until
we
have
accomplished
the
thing
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
us
wherefore
let
us
be
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
lord
therefore
let
us
go
down
to
the
land
of
our
fathers
inheritance
for
behold
he
left
gold
and
silver
and
all
manner
of
riches
and
all
this
he
hath
done
because
of
the
commandments
of
the
lord
for
he
knew
that
jerusalem
must
be
destroyed
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
for
behold
they
have
rejected
the
words
of
the
prophets
wherefore
if
my
father
should
dwell
in
the
land
after
he
hath
been
commanded
to
flee
out
of
the
land
behold
he
would
also
perish
wherefore
it
must
needs
be
that
he
flee
out
of
the
land
and
behold
it
is
wisdom
in
god
that
we
should
obtain
these
records
that
we
may
preserve
unto
our
children
the
language
of
our
fathers
and
also
that
we
may
preserve
unto
them
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
the
holy
prophets
which
have
been
delivered
unto
them
by
the
spirit
and
power
of
god
since
the
world
began
even
down
unto
this
present
time
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
this
manner
of
language
did
I
persuade
my
brethren
that
they
might
be
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
god
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
down
to
the
land
of
our
inheritance
and
we
did
gather
together
our
gold
and
our
silver
and
our
precious
things
and
after
we
had
gathered
these
things
together
we
went
up
again
unto
the
house
of
laban
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
in
unto
laban
and
desired
him
that
he
would
give
unto
us
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
for
which
we
would
give
unto
him
our
gold
and
our
silver
and
all
our
precious
things
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
laban
saw
our
property
and
that
it
was
exceedingly
great
he
did
lust
after
it
insomuch
that
he
thrust
us
out
and
sent
his
servants
to
slay
us
that
he
might
obtain
our
property
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
flee
before
the
servants
of
laban
and
we
were
obliged
to
leave
behind
our
property
and
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
laban
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
fled
into
the
wilderness
and
the
servants
of
laban
did
not
overtake
us
and
we
hid
ourselves
in
the
cavity
of
a
rock
and
it
came
to
pass
that
laman
was
angry
with
me
and
also
with
my
father
and
also
was
lemuel
for
he
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
laman
wherefore
laman
and
lemuel
did
speak
many
hard
words
unto
us
their
younger
brothers
and
they
did
smite
us
even
with
a
rod
and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
smote
us
with
a
rod
behold
an
angel
of
the
lord
came
and
stood
before
them
and
he
spake
unto
them
saying
why
do
ye
smite
your
younger
brother
with
a
rod
know
ye
not
that
the
lord
hath
chosen
him
to
be
a
ruler
over
you
and
this
because
of
your
iniquities
behold
ye
shall
go
up
to
jerusalem
again
and
the
lord
will
deliver
laban
into
your
hands
and
after
the
angel
had
spoken
unto
us
he
departed
and
after
the
angel
had
departed
laman
and
lemuel
again
began
to
murmur
saying
how
is
it
possible
that
the
lord
will
deliver
laban
into
our
hands
behold
he
is
a
mighty
man
and
he
can
command
fifty
yea
even
he
can
slay
fifty
then
why
not
us
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
spake
unto
my
brethren
saying
let
us
go
up
again
unto
jerusalem
and
let
us
be
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
lord
for
behold
he
is
mightier
than
all
the
earth
then
why
not
mightier
than
laban
and
his
fifty
yea
or
even
than
his
tens
of
thousands
therefore
let
us
go
up
let
us
be
strong
like
unto
moses
for
he
truly
spake
unto
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
and
they
divided
hither
and
thither
and
our
fathers
came
through
out
of
captivity
on
dry
ground
and
the
armies
of
pharaoh
did
follow
and
were
drowned
in
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
now
behold
ye
know
that
this
is
true
and
ye
also
know
that
an
angel
hath
spoken
unto
you
wherefore
can
ye
doubt
let
us
go
up
the
lord
is
able
to
deliver
us
even
as
our
fathers
and
to
destroy
laban
even
as
the
egyptians
now
when
I
had
spoken
these
words
they
were
yet
wroth
and
did
still
continue
to
murmur
nevertheless
they
did
follow
me
up
until
we
came
without
the
walls
of
jerusalem
and
it
was
by
night
and
I
caused
that
they
should
hide
themselves
without
the
walls
and
after
they
had
hid
themselves
I
nephi
crept
into
the
city
and
went
forth
towards
the
house
of
laban
and
I
was
led
by
the
spirit
not
knowing
beforehand
the
things
which
I
should
do
nevertheless
I
went
forth
and
as
I
came
near
unto
the
house
of
laban
I
beheld
a
man
and
he
had
fallen
to
the
earth
before
me
for
he
was
drunken
with
wine
and
when
I
came
to
him
I
found
that
it
was
laban
and
I
beheld
his
sword
and
I
drew
it
forth
from
the
sheath
thereof
and
the
hilt
thereof
was
of
pure
gold
and
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceedingly
fine
and
I
saw
that
the
blade
thereof
was
of
the
most
precious
steel
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
was
constrained
by
the
spirit
that
I
should
kill
laban
but
I
said
in
my
heart
never
at
any
time
have
I
shed
the
blood
of
man
and
I
shrunk
and
would
that
I
might
not
slay
him
and
the
spirit
said
unto
me
again
behold
the
lord
hath
delivered
him
into
thy
hands
yea
and
I
also
knew
that
he
had
sought
to
take
away
mine
own
life
yea
and
he
would
not
hearken
unto
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
he
also
had
taken
away
our
property
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
spirit
said
unto
me
again
slay
him
for
the
lord
hath
delivered
him
into
thy
hands
behold
the
lord
slayeth
the
wicked
to
bring
forth
his
righteous
purposes
It
is
better
that
one
man
should
perish
than
that
a
nation
should
dwindle
and
perish
in
unbelief
and
now
when
I
nephi
had
heard
these
words
I
remembered
the
words
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
unto
me
in
the
wilderness
saying
that
Inasmuch
as
thy
seed
shall
keep
my
commandments
they
shall
prosper
in
the
land
of
promise
yea
and
I
also
thought
that
they
could
not
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
according
to
the
law
of
moses
save
they
should
have
the
law
and
I
also
knew
that
the
law
was
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
and
again
I
knew
that
the
lord
had
delivered
laban
into
my
hands
for
this
causethat
I
might
obtain
the
records
according
to
his
commandments
therefore
I
did
obey
the
voice
of
the
spirit
and
took
laban
by
the
hair
of
the
head
and
I
smote
off
his
head
with
his
own
sword
and
after
I
had
smitten
off
his
head
with
his
own
sword
I
took
the
garments
of
laban
and
put
them
upon
mine
own
body
yea
even
every
whit
and
I
did
gird
on
his
armor
about
my
loins
and
after
I
had
done
this
I
went
forth
unto
the
treasury
of
laban
and
as
I
went
forth
towards
the
treasury
of
laban
behold
I
saw
the
servant
of
laban
who
had
the
keys
of
the
treasury
and
I
commanded
him
in
the
voice
of
laban
that
he
should
go
with
me
into
the
treasury
and
he
supposed
me
to
be
his
master
laban
for
he
beheld
the
garments
and
also
the
sword
girded
about
my
loins
and
he
spake
unto
me
concerning
the
elders
of
the
jews
he
knowing
that
his
master
laban
had
been
out
by
night
among
them
and
I
spake
unto
him
as
if
it
had
been
laban
and
I
also
spake
unto
him
that
I
should
carry
the
engravings
which
were
upon
the
plates
of
brass
to
my
elder
brethren
who
were
without
the
walls
and
I
also
bade
him
that
he
should
follow
me
and
he
supposing
that
I
spake
of
the
brethren
of
the
church
and
that
I
was
truly
that
laban
whom
I
had
slain
wherefore
he
did
follow
me
and
he
spake
unto
me
many
times
concerning
the
elders
of
the
jews
as
I
went
forth
unto
my
brethren
who
were
without
the
walls
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
laman
saw
me
he
was
exceedingly
frightened
and
also
lemuel
and
sam
and
they
fled
from
before
my
presence
for
they
supposed
it
was
laban
and
that
he
had
slain
me
and
had
sought
to
take
away
their
lives
also
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
called
after
them
and
they
did
hear
me
wherefore
they
did
cease
to
flee
from
my
presence
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
servant
of
laban
beheld
my
brethren
he
began
to
tremble
and
was
about
to
flee
from
before
me
and
return
to
the
city
of
jerusalem
and
now
I
nephi
being
a
man
large
in
stature
and
also
having
received
much
strength
of
the
lord
therefore
I
did
seize
upon
the
servant
of
laban
and
held
him
that
he
should
not
flee
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
spake
with
him
that
if
he
would
hearken
unto
my
words
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
I
live
even
so
that
if
he
would
hearken
unto
our
words
we
would
spare
his
life
and
I
spake
unto
him
even
with
an
oath
that
he
need
not
fear
that
he
should
be
a
free
man
like
unto
us
if
he
would
go
down
in
the
wilderness
with
us
and
I
also
spake
unto
him
saying
surely
the
lord
hath
commanded
us
to
do
this
thing
and
shall
we
not
be
diligent
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
lord
therefore
if
thou
wilt
go
down
into
the
wilderness
to
my
father
thou
shalt
have
place
with
us
and
it
came
to
pass
that
zoram
did
take
courage
at
the
words
which
I
spake
now
zoram
was
the
name
of
the
servant
and
he
promised
that
he
would
go
down
into
the
wilderness
unto
our
father
yea
and
he
also
made
an
oath
unto
us
that
he
would
tarry
with
us
from
that
time
forth
now
we
were
desirous
that
he
should
tarry
with
us
for
this
cause
that
the
jews
might
not
know
concerning
our
flight
into
the
wilderness
lest
they
should
pursue
us
and
destroy
us
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
zoram
had
made
an
oath
unto
us
our
fears
did
cease
concerning
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
took
the
plates
of
brass
and
the
servant
of
laban
and
departed
into
the
wilderness
and
journeyed
unto
the
tent
of
our
father
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
come
down
into
the
wilderness
unto
our
father
behold
he
was
filled
with
joy
and
also
my
mother
sariah
was
exceedingly
glad
for
she
truly
had
mourned
because
of
us
for
she
had
supposed
that
we
had
perished
in
the
wilderness
and
she
also
had
complained
against
my
father
telling
him
that
he
was
a
visionary
man
saying
behold
thou
hast
led
us
forth
from
the
land
of
our
inheritance
and
my
sons
are
no
more
and
we
perish
in
the
wilderness
and
after
this
manner
of
language
had
my
mother
complained
against
my
father
and
it
had
come
to
pass
that
my
father
spake
unto
her
saying
I
know
that
I
am
a
visionary
man
for
if
I
had
not
seen
the
things
of
god
in
a
vision
I
should
not
have
known
the
goodness
of
god
but
had
tarried
at
jerusalem
and
had
perished
with
my
brethren
but
behold
I
have
obtained
a
land
of
promise
in
the
which
things
I
do
rejoice
yea
and
I
know
that
the
lord
will
deliver
my
sons
out
of
the
hands
of
laban
and
bring
them
down
again
unto
us
in
the
wilderness
and
after
this
manner
of
language
did
my
father
lehi
comfort
my
mother
sariah
concerning
us
while
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
up
to
the
land
of
jerusalem
to
obtain
the
record
of
the
jews
and
when
we
had
returned
to
the
tent
of
my
father
behold
their
joy
was
full
and
my
mother
was
comforted
and
she
spake
saying
now
I
know
of
a
surety
that
the
lord
hath
commanded
my
husband
to
flee
into
the
wilderness
yea
and
I
also
know
of
a
surety
that
the
lord
hath
protected
my
sons
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
laban
and
given
them
power
whereby
they
could
accomplish
the
thing
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
them
and
after
this
manner
of
language
did
she
speak
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
rejoice
exceedingly
and
did
offer
sacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
unto
the
lord
and
they
gave
thanks
unto
the
god
of
Israel
and
after
they
had
given
thanks
unto
the
god
of
Israel
my
father
lehi
took
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
and
he
did
search
them
from
the
beginning
and
he
beheld
that
they
did
contain
the
five
books
of
moses
which
gave
an
account
of
the
creation
of
the
world
and
also
of
adam
and
eve
who
were
our
first
parents
and
also
a
record
of
the
jews
from
the
beginning
even
down
to
the
commencement
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah
and
also
the
prophecies
of
the
holy
prophets
from
the
beginning
even
down
to
the
commencement
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
and
also
many
prophecies
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
jeremiah
and
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
lehi
also
found
upon
the
plates
of
brass
a
genealogy
of
his
fathers
wherefore
he
knew
that
he
was
a
descendant
of
joseph
yea
even
that
joseph
who
was
the
son
of
jacob
who
was
sold
into
egypt
and
who
was
preserved
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
that
he
might
preserve
his
father
jacob
and
all
his
household
from
perishing
with
famine
and
they
were
also
led
out
of
captivity
and
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
by
that
same
god
who
had
preserved
them
and
thus
my
father
lehi
did
discover
the
genealogy
of
his
fathers
and
laban
also
was
a
descendant
of
joseph
wherefore
he
and
his
fathers
had
kept
the
records
and
now
when
my
father
saw
all
these
things
he
was
filled
with
the
spirit
and
began
to
prophesy
concerning
his
seed
that
these
plates
of
brass
should
go
forth
unto
all
nations
kindreds
tongues
and
people
who
were
of
his
seed
wherefore
he
said
that
these
plates
of
brass
should
never
perish
neither
should
they
be
dimmed
any
more
by
time
and
he
prophesied
many
things
concerning
his
seed
and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
far
I
and
my
father
had
kept
the
commandments
wherewith
the
lord
had
commanded
us
and
we
had
obtained
the
records
which
the
lord
had
commanded
us
and
searched
them
and
found
that
they
were
desirable
yea
even
of
great
worth
unto
us
insomuch
that
we
could
preserve
the
commandments
of
the
lord
unto
our
children
wherefore
it
was
wisdom
in
the
lord
that
we
should
carry
them
with
us
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
towards
the
land
of
promise
and
now
I
nephi
do
not
give
the
genealogy
of
my
fathers
in
this
part
of
my
record
neither
at
any
time
shall
I
give
it
after
upon
these
plates
which
I
am
writing
for
it
is
given
in
the
record
which
has
been
kept
by
my
father
wherefore
I
do
not
write
it
in
this
work
for
it
sufficeth
me
to
say
that
we
are
descendants
of
joseph
and
it
mattereth
not
to
me
that
I
am
particular
to
give
a
full
account
of
all
the
things
of
my
father
for
they
cannot
be
written
upon
these
plates
for
I
desire
the
room
that
I
may
write
of
the
things
of
god
for
the
fulness
of
mine
intent
is
that
I
may
persuade
men
to
come
unto
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
Isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
and
be
saved
wherefore
the
things
which
are
pleasing
unto
the
world
I
do
not
write
but
the
things
which
are
pleasing
unto
god
and
unto
those
who
are
not
of
the
world
wherefore
I
shall
give
commandment
unto
my
seed
that
they
shall
not
occupy
these
plates
with
things
which
are
not
of
worth
unto
the
children
of
men
and
now
I
would
that
ye
might
know
that
after
my
father
lehi
had
made
an
end
of
prophesying
concerning
his
seed
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
him
again
saying
that
it
was
not
meet
for
him
lehi
that
he
should
take
his
family
into
the
wilderness
alone
but
that
his
sons
should
take
daughters
to
wife
that
they
might
raise
up
seed
unto
the
lord
in
the
land
of
promise
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
commanded
him
that
I
nephi
and
my
brethren
should
again
return
unto
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
bring
down
Ishmael
and
his
family
into
the
wilderness
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
again
with
my
brethren
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
to
go
up
to
jerusalem
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
up
unto
the
house
of
Ishmael
and
we
did
gain
favor
in
the
sight
of
Ishmael
insomuch
that
we
did
speak
unto
him
the
words
of
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
soften
the
heart
of
Ishmael
and
also
his
household
insomuch
that
they
took
their
journey
with
us
down
into
the
wilderness
to
the
tent
of
our
father
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
behold
laman
and
lemuel
and
two
of
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
and
the
two
sons
of
Ishmael
and
their
families
did
rebel
against
us
yea
against
me
nephi
and
sam
and
their
father
Ishmael
and
his
wife
and
his
three
other
daughters
and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
which
rebellion
they
were
desirous
to
return
unto
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
now
I
nephi
being
grieved
for
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
therefore
I
spake
unto
them
saying
yea
even
unto
laman
and
unto
lemuel
behold
ye
are
mine
elder
brethren
and
how
is
it
that
ye
are
so
hard
in
your
hearts
and
so
blind
in
your
minds
that
ye
have
need
that
I
your
younger
brother
should
speak
unto
you
yea
and
set
an
example
for
you
how
is
it
that
ye
have
not
hearkened
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
how
is
it
that
ye
have
forgotten
that
ye
have
seen
an
angel
of
the
lord
yea
and
how
is
it
that
ye
have
forgotten
what
great
things
the
lord
hath
done
for
us
in
delivering
us
out
of
the
hands
of
laban
and
also
that
we
should
obtain
the
record
yea
and
how
is
it
that
ye
have
forgotten
that
the
lord
is
able
to
do
all
things
according
to
his
will
for
the
children
of
men
if
it
so
be
that
they
exercise
faith
in
him
wherefore
let
us
be
faithful
to
him
and
if
it
so
be
that
we
are
faithful
to
him
we
shall
obtain
the
land
of
promise
and
ye
shall
know
at
some
future
period
that
the
word
of
the
lord
shall
be
fulfilled
concerning
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
for
all
things
which
the
lord
hath
spoken
concerning
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
must
be
fulfilled
for
behold
the
spirit
of
the
lord
ceaseth
soon
to
strive
with
them
for
behold
they
have
rejected
the
prophets
and
jeremiah
have
they
cast
into
prison
and
they
have
sought
to
take
away
the
life
of
my
father
insomuch
that
they
have
driven
him
out
of
the
land
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
will
return
unto
jerusalem
ye
shall
also
perish
with
them
and
now
if
ye
have
choice
go
up
to
the
land
and
remember
the
words
which
I
speak
unto
you
that
if
ye
go
ye
will
also
perish
for
thus
the
spirit
of
the
lord
constraineth
me
that
I
should
speak
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
nephi
had
spoken
these
words
unto
my
brethren
they
were
angry
with
me
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
lay
their
hands
upon
me
for
behold
they
were
exceedingly
wroth
and
they
did
bind
me
with
cords
for
they
sought
to
take
away
my
life
that
they
might
leave
me
in
the
wilderness
to
be
devoured
by
wild
beasts
but
it
came
to
pass
that
I
prayed
unto
the
lord
saying
o
lord
according
to
my
faith
which
is
in
thee
wilt
thou
deliver
me
from
the
hands
of
my
brethren
yea
even
give
me
strength
that
I
may
burst
these
bands
with
which
I
am
bound
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
had
said
these
words
behold
the
bands
were
loosed
from
off
my
hands
and
feet
and
I
stood
before
my
brethren
and
I
spake
unto
them
again
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
angry
with
me
again
and
sought
to
lay
hands
upon
me
but
behold
one
of
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
yea
and
also
her
mother
and
one
of
the
sons
of
Ishmael
did
plead
with
my
brethren
insomuch
that
they
did
soften
their
hearts
and
they
did
cease
striving
to
take
away
my
life
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
sorrowful
because
of
their
wickedness
insomuch
that
they
did
bow
down
before
me
and
did
plead
with
me
that
I
would
forgive
them
of
the
thing
that
they
had
done
against
me
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
frankly
forgive
them
all
that
they
had
done
and
I
did
exhort
them
that
they
would
pray
unto
the
lord
their
god
for
forgiveness
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
so
and
after
they
had
done
praying
unto
the
lord
we
did
again
travel
on
our
journey
towards
the
tent
of
our
father
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
come
down
unto
the
tent
of
our
father
and
after
I
and
my
brethren
and
all
the
house
of
Ishmael
had
come
down
unto
the
tent
of
my
father
they
did
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
their
god
and
they
did
offer
sacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
unto
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
had
gathered
together
all
manner
of
seeds
of
every
kind
both
of
grain
of
every
kind
and
also
of
the
seeds
of
fruit
of
every
kind
and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
my
father
tarried
in
the
wilderness
he
spake
unto
us
saying
behold
I
have
dreamed
a
dream
or
in
other
words
I
have
seen
a
vision
and
behold
because
of
the
thing
which
I
have
seen
I
have
reason
to
rejoice
in
the
lord
because
of
nephi
and
also
of
sam
for
I
have
reason
to
suppose
that
they
and
also
many
of
their
seed
will
be
saved
but
behold
laman
and
lemuel
I
fear
exceedingly
because
of
you
for
behold
methought
I
saw
in
my
dream
a
dark
and
dreary
wilderness
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
a
man
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
white
robe
and
he
came
and
stood
before
me
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
me
and
bade
me
follow
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
I
followed
him
I
beheld
myself
that
I
was
in
a
dark
and
dreary
waste
and
after
I
had
traveled
for
the
space
of
many
hours
in
darkness
I
began
to
pray
unto
the
lord
that
he
would
have
mercy
on
me
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
tender
mercies
and
it
came
to
pass
after
I
had
prayed
unto
the
lord
I
beheld
a
large
and
spacious
field
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
a
tree
whose
fruit
was
desirable
to
make
one
happy
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
go
forth
and
partake
of
the
fruit
thereof
and
I
beheld
that
it
was
most
sweet
above
all
that
I
ever
before
tasted
yea
and
I
beheld
that
the
fruit
thereof
was
white
to
exceed
all
the
whiteness
that
I
had
ever
seen
and
as
I
partook
of
the
fruit
thereof
it
filled
my
soul
with
exceedingly
great
joy
wherefore
I
began
to
be
desirous
that
my
family
should
partake
of
it
also
for
I
knew
that
it
was
desirable
above
all
other
fruit
and
as
I
cast
my
eyes
round
about
that
perhaps
I
might
discover
my
family
also
I
beheld
a
river
of
water
and
it
ran
along
and
it
was
near
the
tree
of
which
I
was
partaking
the
fruit
and
I
looked
to
behold
from
whence
it
came
and
I
saw
the
head
thereof
a
little
way
off
and
at
the
head
thereof
I
beheld
your
mother
sariah
and
sam
and
nephi
and
they
stood
as
if
they
knew
not
whither
they
should
go
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beckoned
unto
them
and
I
also
did
say
unto
them
with
a
loud
voice
that
they
should
come
unto
me
and
partake
of
the
fruit
which
was
desirable
above
all
other
fruit
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
unto
me
and
partake
of
the
fruit
also
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
was
desirous
that
laman
and
lemuel
should
come
and
partake
of
the
fruit
also
wherefore
I
cast
mine
eyes
towards
the
head
of
the
river
that
perhaps
I
might
see
them
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
them
but
they
would
not
come
unto
me
and
partake
of
the
fruit
and
I
beheld
a
rod
of
iron
and
it
extended
along
the
bank
of
the
river
and
led
to
the
tree
by
which
I
stood
and
I
also
beheld
a
strait
and
narrow
path
which
came
along
by
the
rod
of
iron
even
to
the
tree
by
which
I
stood
and
it
also
led
by
the
head
of
the
fountain
unto
a
large
and
spacious
field
as
if
it
had
been
a
world
and
I
saw
numberless
concourses
of
people
many
of
whom
were
pressing
forward
that
they
might
obtain
the
path
which
led
unto
the
tree
by
which
I
stood
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
forth
and
commence
in
the
path
which
led
to
the
tree
and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
a
mist
of
darkness
yea
even
an
exceedingly
great
mist
of
darkness
insomuch
that
they
who
had
commenced
in
the
path
did
lose
their
way
that
they
wandered
off
and
were
lost
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
others
pressing
forward
and
they
came
forth
and
caught
hold
of
the
end
of
the
rod
of
iron
and
they
did
press
forward
through
the
mist
of
darkness
clinging
to
the
rod
of
iron
even
until
they
did
come
forth
and
partake
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
and
after
they
had
partaken
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
they
did
cast
their
eyes
about
as
if
they
were
ashamed
and
I
also
cast
my
eyes
round
about
and
beheld
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
of
water
a
great
and
spacious
building
and
it
stood
as
it
were
in
the
air
high
above
the
earth
and
it
was
filled
with
people
both
old
and
young
both
male
and
female
and
their
manner
of
dress
was
exceedingly
fine
and
they
were
in
the
attitude
of
mocking
and
pointing
their
fingers
towards
those
who
had
come
at
and
were
partaking
of
the
fruit
and
after
they
had
tasted
of
the
fruit
they
were
ashamed
because
of
those
that
were
scoffing
at
them
and
they
fell
away
into
forbidden
paths
and
were
lost
and
now
I
nephi
do
not
speak
all
the
words
of
my
father
but
to
be
short
in
writing
behold
he
saw
other
multitudes
pressing
forward
and
they
came
and
caught
hold
of
the
end
of
the
rod
of
iron
and
they
did
press
their
way
forward
continually
holding
fast
to
the
rod
of
iron
until
they
came
forth
and
fell
down
and
partook
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
and
he
also
saw
other
multitudes
feeling
their
way
towards
that
great
and
spacious
building
and
it
came
to
pass
that
many
were
drowned
in
the
depths
of
the
fountain
and
many
were
lost
from
his
view
wandering
in
strange
roads
and
great
was
the
multitude
that
did
enter
into
that
strange
building
and
after
they
did
enter
into
that
building
they
did
point
the
finger
of
scorn
at
me
and
those
that
were
partaking
of
the
fruit
also
but
we
heeded
them
not
these
are
the
words
of
my
father
for
as
many
as
heeded
them
had
fallen
away
and
laman
and
lemuel
partook
not
of
the
fruit
said
my
father
and
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
had
spoken
all
the
words
of
his
dream
or
vision
which
were
many
he
said
unto
us
because
of
these
things
which
he
saw
in
a
vision
he
exceedingly
feared
for
laman
and
lemuel
yea
he
feared
lest
they
should
be
cast
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
he
did
exhort
them
then
with
all
the
feeling
of
a
tender
parent
that
they
would
hearken
to
his
words
that
perhaps
the
lord
would
be
merciful
to
them
and
not
cast
them
off
yea
my
father
did
preach
unto
them
and
after
he
had
preached
unto
them
and
also
prophesied
unto
them
of
many
things
he
bade
them
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
he
did
cease
speaking
unto
them
and
all
these
things
did
my
father
see
and
hear
and
speak
as
he
dwelt
in
a
tent
in
the
valley
of
lemuel
and
also
a
great
many
more
things
which
cannot
be
written
upon
these
plates
and
now
as
I
have
spoken
concerning
these
plates
behold
they
are
not
the
plates
upon
which
I
make
a
full
account
of
the
history
of
my
people
for
the
plates
upon
which
I
make
a
full
account
of
my
people
I
have
given
the
name
of
nephi
wherefore
they
are
called
the
plates
of
nephi
after
mine
own
name
and
these
plates
also
are
called
the
plates
of
nephi
nevertheless
I
have
received
a
commandment
of
the
lord
that
I
should
make
these
plates
for
the
special
purpose
that
there
should
be
an
account
engraven
of
the
ministry
of
my
people
upon
the
other
plates
should
be
engraven
an
account
of
the
reign
of
the
kings
and
the
wars
and
contentions
of
my
people
wherefore
these
plates
are
for
the
more
part
of
the
ministry
and
the
other
plates
are
for
the
more
part
of
the
reign
of
the
kings
and
the
wars
and
contentions
of
my
people
wherefore
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
to
make
these
plates
for
a
wise
purpose
in
him
which
purpose
I
know
not
but
the
lord
knoweth
all
things
from
the
beginning
wherefore
he
prepareth
a
way
to
accomplish
all
his
works
among
the
children
of
men
for
behold
he
hath
all
power
unto
the
fulfilling
of
all
his
words
and
thus
it
is
amen
and
now
I
nephi
proceed
to
give
an
account
upon
these
plates
of
my
proceedings
and
my
reign
and
ministry
wherefore
to
proceed
with
mine
account
I
must
speak
somewhat
of
the
things
of
my
father
and
also
of
my
brethren
for
behold
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
the
words
of
his
dream
and
also
of
exhorting
them
to
all
diligence
he
spake
unto
them
concerning
the
jews
that
after
they
should
be
destroyed
even
that
great
city
jerusalem
and
many
be
carried
away
captive
into
babylon
according
to
the
own
due
time
of
the
lord
they
should
return
again
yea
even
be
brought
back
out
of
captivity
and
after
they
should
be
brought
back
out
of
captivity
they
should
possess
again
the
land
of
their
inheritance
yea
even
six
hundred
years
from
the
time
that
my
father
left
jerusalem
a
prophet
would
the
lord
god
raise
up
among
the
jewseven
a
messiah
or
in
other
words
a
savior
of
the
world
and
he
also
spake
concerning
the
prophets
how
great
a
number
had
testified
of
these
things
concerning
this
messiah
of
whom
he
had
spoken
or
this
redeemer
of
the
world
wherefore
all
mankind
were
in
a
lost
and
in
a
fallen
state
and
ever
would
be
save
they
should
rely
on
this
redeemer
and
he
spake
also
concerning
a
prophet
who
should
come
before
the
messiah
to
prepare
the
way
of
the
lord
yea
even
he
should
go
forth
and
cry
in
the
wilderness
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
and
make
his
paths
straight
for
there
standeth
one
among
you
whom
ye
know
not
and
he
is
mightier
than
I
whose
shoes
latchet
I
am
not
worthy
to
unloose
and
much
spake
my
father
concerning
this
thing
and
my
father
said
he
should
baptize
in
bethabara
beyond
jordan
and
he
also
said
he
should
baptize
with
water
even
that
he
should
baptize
the
messiah
with
water
and
after
he
had
baptized
the
messiah
with
water
he
should
behold
and
bear
record
that
he
had
baptized
the
lamb
of
god
who
should
take
away
the
sins
of
the
world
and
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
had
spoken
these
words
he
spake
unto
my
brethren
concerning
the
gospel
which
should
be
preached
among
the
jews
and
also
concerning
the
dwindling
of
the
jews
in
unbelief
and
after
they
had
slain
the
messiah
who
should
come
and
after
he
had
been
slain
he
should
rise
from
the
dead
and
should
make
himself
manifest
by
the
holy
ghost
unto
the
gentiles
yea
even
my
father
spake
much
concerning
the
gentiles
and
also
concerning
the
house
of
Israel
that
they
should
be
compared
like
unto
an
olivetree
whose
branches
should
be
broken
off
and
should
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
wherefore
he
said
it
must
needs
be
that
we
should
be
led
with
one
accord
into
the
land
of
promise
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
word
of
the
lord
that
we
should
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
after
the
house
of
Israel
should
be
scattered
they
should
be
gathered
together
again
or
in
fine
after
the
gentiles
had
received
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
the
natural
branches
of
the
olivetree
or
the
remnants
of
the
house
of
Israel
should
be
grafted
in
or
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
true
messiah
their
lord
and
their
redeemer
and
after
this
manner
of
language
did
my
father
prophesy
and
speak
unto
my
brethren
and
also
many
more
things
which
I
do
not
write
in
this
book
for
I
have
written
as
many
of
them
as
were
expedient
for
me
in
mine
other
book
and
all
these
things
of
which
I
have
spoken
were
done
as
my
father
dwelt
in
a
tent
in
the
valley
of
lemuel
and
it
came
to
pass
after
I
nephi
having
heard
all
the
words
of
my
father
concerning
the
things
which
he
saw
in
a
vision
and
also
the
things
which
he
spake
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
which
power
he
received
by
faith
on
the
son
of
godand
the
son
of
god
was
the
messiah
who
should
comeI
nephi
was
desirous
also
that
I
might
see
and
hear
and
know
of
these
things
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
which
is
the
gift
of
god
unto
all
those
who
diligently
seek
him
as
well
in
times
of
old
as
in
the
time
that
he
should
manifest
himself
unto
the
children
of
men
for
he
is
the
same
yesterday
today
and
forever
and
the
way
is
prepared
for
all
men
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
if
it
so
be
that
they
repent
and
come
unto
him
for
he
that
diligently
seeketh
shall
find
and
the
mysteries
of
god
shall
be
unfolded
unto
them
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
as
well
in
these
times
as
in
times
of
old
and
as
well
in
times
of
old
as
in
times
to
come
wherefore
the
course
of
the
lord
is
one
eternal
round
therefore
remember
o
man
for
all
thy
doings
thou
shalt
be
brought
into
judgment
wherefore
if
ye
have
sought
to
do
wickedly
in
the
days
of
your
probation
then
ye
are
found
unclean
before
the
judgmentseat
of
god
and
no
unclean
thing
can
dwell
with
god
wherefore
ye
must
be
cast
off
forever
and
the
holy
ghost
giveth
authority
that
I
should
speak
these
things
and
deny
them
not
for
it
came
to
pass
after
I
had
desired
to
know
the
things
that
my
father
had
seen
and
believing
that
the
lord
was
able
to
make
them
known
unto
me
as
I
sat
pondering
in
mine
heart
I
was
caught
away
in
the
spirit
of
the
lord
yea
into
an
exceedingly
high
mountain
which
I
never
had
before
seen
and
upon
which
I
never
had
before
set
my
foot
and
the
spirit
said
unto
me
behold
what
desirest
thou
and
I
said
I
desire
to
behold
the
things
which
my
father
saw
and
the
spirit
said
unto
me
believest
thou
that
thy
father
saw
the
tree
of
which
he
hath
spoken
and
I
said
yea
thou
knowest
that
I
believe
all
the
words
of
my
father
and
when
I
had
spoken
these
words
the
spirit
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
hosanna
to
the
lord
the
most
high
god
for
he
is
god
over
all
the
earth
yea
even
above
all
and
blessed
art
thou
nephi
because
thou
believest
in
the
son
of
the
most
high
god
wherefore
thou
shalt
behold
the
things
which
thou
hast
desired
and
behold
this
thing
shall
be
given
unto
thee
for
a
sign
that
after
thou
hast
beheld
the
tree
which
bore
the
fruit
which
thy
father
tasted
thou
shalt
also
behold
a
man
descending
out
of
heaven
and
him
shall
ye
witness
and
after
ye
have
witnessed
him
ye
shall
bear
record
that
it
is
the
son
of
god
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
spirit
said
unto
me
look
and
I
looked
and
beheld
a
tree
and
it
was
like
unto
the
tree
which
my
father
had
seen
and
the
beauty
thereof
was
far
beyond
yea
exceeding
of
all
beauty
and
the
whiteness
thereof
did
exceed
the
whiteness
of
the
driven
snow
and
it
came
to
pass
after
I
had
seen
the
tree
I
said
unto
the
spirit
I
behold
thou
hast
shown
unto
me
the
tree
which
is
precious
above
all
and
he
said
unto
me
what
desirest
thou
and
I
said
unto
him
to
know
the
interpretation
thereoffor
I
spake
unto
him
as
a
man
speaketh
for
I
beheld
that
he
was
in
the
form
of
a
man
yet
nevertheless
I
knew
that
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
lord
and
he
spake
unto
me
as
a
man
speaketh
with
another
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
me
look
and
I
looked
as
if
to
look
upon
him
and
I
saw
him
not
for
he
had
gone
from
before
my
presence
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
looked
and
beheld
the
great
city
of
jerusalem
and
also
other
cities
and
I
beheld
the
city
of
nazareth
and
in
the
city
of
nazareth
I
beheld
a
virgin
and
she
was
exceedingly
fair
and
white
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
the
heavens
open
and
an
angel
came
down
and
stood
before
me
and
he
said
unto
me
nephi
what
beholdest
thou
and
I
said
unto
him
a
virgin
most
beautiful
and
fair
above
all
other
virgins
and
he
said
unto
me
knowest
thou
the
condescension
of
god
and
I
said
unto
him
I
know
that
he
loveth
his
children
nevertheless
I
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
all
things
and
he
said
unto
me
behold
the
virgin
whom
thou
seest
is
the
mother
of
the
son
of
god
after
the
manner
of
the
flesh
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
that
she
was
carried
away
in
the
spirit
and
after
she
had
been
carried
away
in
the
spirit
for
the
space
of
a
time
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
look
and
I
looked
and
beheld
the
virgin
again
bearing
a
child
in
her
arms
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
behold
the
lamb
of
god
yea
even
the
son
of
the
eternal
father
knowest
thou
the
meaning
of
the
tree
which
thy
father
saw
and
I
answered
him
saying
yea
it
is
the
love
of
god
which
sheddeth
itself
abroad
in
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
wherefore
it
is
the
most
desirable
above
all
things
and
he
spake
unto
me
saying
yea
and
the
most
joyous
to
the
soul
and
after
he
had
said
these
words
he
said
unto
me
look
and
I
looked
and
I
beheld
the
son
of
god
going
forth
among
the
children
of
men
and
I
saw
many
fall
down
at
his
feet
and
worship
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
that
the
rod
of
iron
which
my
father
had
seen
was
the
word
of
god
which
led
to
the
fountain
of
living
waters
or
to
the
tree
of
life
which
waters
are
a
representation
of
the
love
of
god
and
I
also
beheld
that
the
tree
of
life
was
a
representation
of
the
love
of
god
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
again
look
and
behold
the
condescension
of
god
and
I
looked
and
beheld
the
redeemer
of
the
world
of
whom
my
father
had
spoken
and
I
also
beheld
the
prophet
who
should
prepare
the
way
before
him
and
the
lamb
of
god
went
forth
and
was
baptized
of
him
and
after
he
was
baptized
I
beheld
the
heavens
open
and
the
holy
ghost
come
down
out
of
heaven
and
abide
upon
him
in
the
form
of
a
dove
and
I
beheld
that
he
went
forth
ministering
unto
the
people
in
power
and
great
glory
and
the
multitudes
were
gathered
together
to
hear
him
and
I
beheld
that
they
cast
him
out
from
among
them
and
I
also
beheld
twelve
others
following
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
carried
away
in
the
spirit
from
before
my
face
and
I
saw
them
not
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
again
saying
look
and
I
looked
and
I
beheld
the
heavens
open
again
and
I
saw
angels
descending
upon
the
children
of
men
and
they
did
minister
unto
them
and
he
spake
unto
me
again
saying
look
and
I
looked
and
I
beheld
the
lamb
of
god
going
forth
among
the
children
of
men
and
I
beheld
multitudes
of
people
who
were
sick
and
who
were
afflicted
with
all
manner
of
diseases
and
with
devils
and
unclean
spirits
and
the
angel
spake
and
showed
all
these
things
unto
me
and
they
were
healed
by
the
power
of
the
lamb
of
god
and
the
devils
and
the
unclean
spirits
were
cast
out
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
again
saying
look
and
I
looked
and
beheld
the
lamb
of
god
that
he
was
taken
by
the
people
yea
the
son
of
the
everlasting
god
was
judged
of
the
world
and
I
saw
and
bear
record
and
I
nephi
saw
that
he
was
lifted
up
upon
the
cross
and
slain
for
the
sins
of
the
world
and
after
he
was
slain
I
saw
the
multitudes
of
the
earth
that
they
were
gathered
together
to
fight
against
the
apostles
of
the
lamb
for
thus
were
the
twelve
called
by
the
angel
of
the
lord
and
the
multitude
of
the
earth
was
gathered
together
and
I
beheld
that
they
were
in
a
large
and
spacious
building
like
unto
the
building
which
my
father
saw
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
spake
unto
me
again
saying
behold
the
world
and
the
wisdom
thereof
yea
behold
the
house
of
Israel
hath
gathered
together
to
fight
against
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
and
bear
record
that
the
great
and
spacious
building
was
the
pride
of
the
world
and
it
fell
and
the
fall
thereof
was
exceedingly
great
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
spake
unto
me
again
saying
thus
shall
be
the
destruction
of
all
nations
kindreds
tongues
and
people
that
shall
fight
against
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
said
unto
me
look
and
behold
thy
seed
and
also
the
seed
of
thy
brethren
and
I
looked
and
beheld
the
land
of
promise
and
I
beheld
multitudes
of
people
yea
even
as
it
were
in
number
as
many
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
multitudes
gathered
together
to
battle
one
against
the
other
and
I
beheld
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
and
great
slaughters
with
the
sword
among
my
people
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
many
generations
pass
away
after
the
manner
of
wars
and
contentions
in
the
land
and
I
beheld
many
cities
yea
even
that
I
did
not
number
them
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
a
mist
of
darkness
on
the
face
of
the
land
of
promise
and
I
saw
lightnings
and
I
heard
thunderings
and
earthquakes
and
all
manner
of
tumultuous
noises
and
I
saw
the
earth
and
the
rocks
that
they
rent
and
I
saw
mountains
tumbling
into
pieces
and
I
saw
the
plains
of
the
earth
that
they
were
broken
up
and
I
saw
many
cities
that
they
were
sunk
and
I
saw
many
that
they
were
burned
with
fire
and
I
saw
many
that
did
tumble
to
the
earth
because
of
the
quaking
thereof
and
it
came
to
pass
after
I
saw
these
things
I
saw
the
vapor
of
darkness
that
it
passed
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
behold
I
saw
multitudes
who
had
not
fallen
because
of
the
great
and
terrible
judgments
of
the
lord
and
I
saw
the
heavens
open
and
the
lamb
of
god
descending
out
of
heaven
and
he
came
down
and
showed
himself
unto
them
and
I
also
saw
and
bear
record
that
the
holy
ghost
fell
upon
twelve
others
and
they
were
ordained
of
god
and
chosen
and
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
the
twelve
disciples
of
the
lamb
who
are
chosen
to
minister
unto
thy
seed
and
he
said
unto
me
thou
rememberest
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
behold
they
are
they
who
shall
judge
the
twelve
tribes
of
Israel
wherefore
the
twelve
ministers
of
thy
seed
shall
be
judged
of
them
for
ye
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
and
these
twelve
ministers
whom
thou
beholdest
shall
judge
thy
seed
and
behold
they
are
righteous
forever
for
because
of
their
faith
in
the
lamb
of
god
their
garments
are
made
white
in
his
blood
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
look
and
I
looked
and
beheld
three
generations
pass
away
in
righteousness
and
their
garments
were
white
even
like
unto
the
lamb
of
god
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
these
are
made
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
because
of
their
faith
in
him
and
I
nephi
also
saw
many
of
the
fourth
generation
who
passed
away
in
righteousness
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
the
multitudes
of
the
earth
gathered
together
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
behold
thy
seed
and
also
the
seed
of
thy
brethren
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
looked
and
beheld
the
people
of
my
seed
gathered
together
in
multitudes
against
the
seed
of
my
brethren
and
they
were
gathered
together
to
battle
and
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
the
fountain
of
filthy
water
which
thy
father
saw
yea
even
the
river
of
which
he
spake
and
the
depths
thereof
are
the
depths
of
hell
and
the
mists
of
darkness
are
the
temptations
of
the
devil
which
blindeth
the
eyes
and
hardeneth
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
and
leadeth
them
away
into
broad
roads
that
they
perish
and
are
lost
and
the
large
and
spacious
building
which
thy
father
saw
is
vain
imaginations
and
the
pride
of
the
children
of
men
and
a
great
and
a
terrible
gulf
divideth
them
yea
even
the
word
of
the
justice
of
the
eternal
god
and
the
messiah
who
is
the
lamb
of
god
of
whom
the
holy
ghost
beareth
record
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
until
this
time
and
from
this
time
henceforth
and
forever
and
while
the
angel
spake
these
words
I
beheld
and
saw
that
the
seed
of
my
brethren
did
contend
against
my
seed
according
to
the
word
of
the
angel
and
because
of
the
pride
of
my
seed
and
the
temptations
of
the
devil
I
beheld
that
the
seed
of
my
brethren
did
overpower
the
people
of
my
seed
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
and
saw
the
people
of
the
seed
of
my
brethren
that
they
had
overcome
my
seed
and
they
went
forth
in
multitudes
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
I
saw
them
gathered
together
in
multitudes
and
I
saw
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
among
them
and
in
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
I
saw
many
generations
pass
away
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
behold
these
shall
dwindle
in
unbelief
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
after
they
had
dwindled
in
unbelief
they
became
a
dark
and
loathsome
and
a
filthy
people
full
of
idleness
and
all
manner
of
abominations
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
look
and
I
looked
and
beheld
many
nations
and
kingdoms
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
what
beholdest
thou
and
I
said
I
behold
many
nations
and
kingdoms
and
he
said
unto
me
these
are
the
nations
and
kingdoms
of
the
gentiles
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
among
the
nations
of
the
gentiles
the
formation
of
a
great
church
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
behold
the
formation
of
a
church
which
is
most
abominable
above
all
other
churches
which
slayeth
the
saints
of
god
yea
and
tortureth
them
and
bindeth
them
down
and
yoketh
them
with
a
yoke
of
iron
and
bringeth
them
down
into
captivity
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
this
great
and
abominable
church
and
I
saw
the
devil
that
he
was
the
founder
of
it
and
I
also
saw
gold
and
silver
and
silks
and
scarlets
and
finetwined
linen
and
all
manner
of
precious
clothing
and
I
saw
many
harlots
and
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
the
gold
and
the
silver
and
the
silks
and
the
scarlets
and
the
finetwined
linen
and
the
precious
clothing
and
the
harlots
are
the
desires
of
this
great
and
abominable
church
and
also
for
the
praise
of
the
world
do
they
destroy
the
saints
of
god
and
bring
them
down
into
captivity
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
looked
and
beheld
many
waters
and
they
divided
the
gentiles
from
the
seed
of
my
brethren
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
said
unto
me
behold
the
wrath
of
god
is
upon
the
seed
of
thy
brethren
and
I
looked
and
beheld
a
man
among
the
gentiles
who
was
separated
from
the
seed
of
my
brethren
by
the
many
waters
and
I
beheld
the
spirit
of
god
that
it
came
down
and
wrought
upon
the
man
and
he
went
forth
upon
the
many
waters
even
unto
the
seed
of
my
brethren
who
were
in
the
promised
land
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
the
spirit
of
god
that
it
wrought
upon
other
gentiles
and
they
went
forth
out
of
captivity
upon
the
many
waters
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
many
multitudes
of
the
gentiles
upon
the
land
of
promise
and
I
beheld
the
wrath
of
god
that
it
was
upon
the
seed
of
my
brethren
and
they
were
scattered
before
the
gentiles
and
were
smitten
and
I
beheld
the
spirit
of
the
lord
that
it
was
upon
the
gentiles
and
they
did
prosper
and
obtain
the
land
for
their
inheritance
and
I
beheld
that
they
were
white
and
exceedingly
fair
and
beautiful
like
unto
my
people
before
they
were
slain
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
beheld
that
the
gentiles
who
had
gone
forth
out
of
captivity
did
humble
themselves
before
the
lord
and
the
power
of
the
lord
was
with
them
and
I
beheld
that
their
mother
gentiles
were
gathered
together
upon
the
waters
and
upon
the
land
also
to
battle
against
them
and
I
beheld
that
the
power
of
god
was
with
them
and
also
that
the
wrath
of
god
was
upon
all
those
that
were
gathered
together
against
them
to
battle
and
I
nephi
beheld
that
the
gentiles
that
had
gone
out
of
captivity
were
delivered
by
the
power
of
god
out
of
the
hands
of
all
other
nations
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
beheld
that
they
did
prosper
in
the
land
and
I
beheld
a
book
and
it
was
carried
forth
among
them
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
knowest
thou
the
meaning
of
the
book
and
I
said
unto
him
I
know
not
and
he
said
behold
it
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
jew
and
I
nephi
beheld
it
and
he
said
unto
me
the
book
that
thou
beholdest
is
a
record
of
the
jews
which
contains
the
covenants
of
the
lord
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
house
of
Israel
and
it
also
containeth
many
of
the
prophecies
of
the
holy
prophets
and
it
is
a
record
like
unto
the
engravings
which
are
upon
the
plates
of
brass
save
there
are
not
so
many
nevertheless
they
contain
the
covenants
of
the
lord
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
house
of
Israel
wherefore
they
are
of
great
worth
unto
the
gentiles
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
me
thou
hast
beheld
that
the
book
proceeded
forth
from
the
mouth
of
a
jew
and
when
it
proceeded
forth
from
the
mouth
of
a
jew
it
contained
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
of
the
lord
of
whom
the
twelve
apostles
bear
record
and
they
bear
record
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
the
lamb
of
god
wherefore
these
things
go
forth
from
the
jews
in
purity
unto
the
gentiles
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
god
and
after
they
go
forth
by
the
hand
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
from
the
jews
unto
the
gentiles
thou
seest
the
formation
of
a
great
and
abominable
church
which
is
most
abominable
above
all
other
churches
for
behold
they
have
taken
away
from
the
gospel
of
the
lamb
many
parts
which
are
plain
and
most
precious
and
also
many
covenants
of
the
lord
have
they
taken
away
and
all
this
have
they
done
that
they
might
pervert
the
right
ways
of
the
lord
that
they
might
blind
the
eyes
and
harden
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
wherefore
thou
seest
that
after
the
book
hath
gone
forth
through
the
hands
of
the
great
and
abominable
church
that
there
are
many
plain
and
precious
things
taken
away
from
the
book
which
is
the
book
of
the
lamb
of
god
and
after
these
plain
and
precious
things
were
taken
away
it
goeth
forth
unto
all
the
nations
of
the
gentiles
and
after
it
goeth
forth
unto
all
the
nations
of
the
gentiles
yea
even
across
the
many
waters
which
thou
hast
seen
with
the
gentiles
which
have
gone
forth
out
of
captivity
thou
seestbecause
of
the
many
plain
and
precious
things
which
have
been
taken
out
of
the
book
which
were
plain
unto
the
understanding
of
the
children
of
men
according
to
the
plainness
which
is
in
the
lamb
of
godbecause
of
these
things
which
are
taken
away
out
of
the
gospel
of
the
lamb
an
exceedingly
great
many
do
stumble
yea
insomuch
that
satan
hath
great
power
over
them
nevertheless
thou
beholdest
that
the
gentiles
who
have
gone
forth
out
of
captivity
and
have
been
lifted
up
by
the
power
of
god
above
all
other
nations
upon
the
face
of
the
land
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands
which
is
the
land
that
the
lord
god
hath
covenanted
with
thy
father
that
his
seed
should
have
for
the
land
of
their
inheritance
wherefore
thou
seest
that
the
lord
god
will
not
suffer
that
the
gentiles
will
utterly
destroy
the
mixture
of
thy
seed
which
are
among
thy
brethren
neither
will
he
suffer
that
the
gentiles
shall
destroy
the
seed
of
thy
brethren
neither
will
the
lord
god
suffer
that
the
gentiles
shall
forever
remain
in
that
awful
state
of
blindness
which
thou
beholdest
they
are
in
because
of
the
plain
and
most
precious
parts
of
the
gospel
of
the
lamb
which
have
been
kept
back
by
that
abominable
church
whose
formation
thou
hast
seen
wherefore
saith
the
lamb
of
god
I
will
be
merciful
unto
the
gentiles
unto
the
visiting
of
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
Israel
in
great
judgment
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
of
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
saith
the
lamb
of
god
after
I
have
visited
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
Israeland
this
remnant
of
whom
I
speak
is
the
seed
of
thy
fatherwherefore
after
I
have
visited
them
in
judgment
and
smitten
them
by
the
hand
of
the
gentiles
and
after
the
gentiles
do
stumble
exceedingly
because
of
the
most
plain
and
precious
parts
of
the
gospel
of
the
lamb
which
have
been
kept
back
by
that
abominable
church
which
is
the
mother
of
harlots
saith
the
lambI
will
be
merciful
unto
the
gentiles
in
that
day
insomuch
that
I
will
bring
forth
unto
them
in
mine
own
power
much
of
my
gospel
which
shall
be
plain
and
precious
saith
the
lamb
for
behold
saith
the
lamb
I
will
manifest
myself
unto
thy
seed
that
they
shall
write
many
things
which
I
shall
minister
unto
them
which
shall
be
plain
and
precious
and
after
thy
seed
shall
be
destroyed
and
dwindle
in
unbelief
and
also
the
seed
of
thy
brethren
behold
these
things
shall
be
hid
up
to
come
forth
unto
the
gentiles
by
the
gift
and
power
of
the
lamb
and
in
them
shall
be
written
my
gospel
saith
the
lamb
and
my
rock
and
my
salvation
and
blessed
are
they
who
shall
seek
to
bring
forth
my
zion
at
that
day
for
they
shall
have
the
gift
and
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
and
if
they
endure
unto
the
end
they
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
and
shall
be
saved
in
the
everlasting
kingdom
of
the
lamb
and
whoso
shall
publish
peace
yea
tidings
of
great
joy
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
shall
they
be
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
my
brethren
and
also
the
book
of
the
lamb
of
god
which
had
proceeded
forth
from
the
mouth
of
the
jew
that
it
came
forth
from
the
gentiles
unto
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
my
brethren
and
after
it
had
come
forth
unto
them
I
beheld
other
books
which
came
forth
by
the
power
of
the
lamb
from
the
gentiles
unto
them
unto
the
convincing
of
the
gentiles
and
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
my
brethren
and
also
the
jews
who
were
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
that
the
records
of
the
prophets
and
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
are
true
and
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
these
last
records
which
thou
hast
seen
among
the
gentiles
shall
establish
the
truth
of
the
first
which
are
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
and
shall
make
known
the
plain
and
precious
things
which
have
been
taken
away
from
them
and
shall
make
known
to
all
kindreds
tongues
and
people
that
the
lamb
of
god
is
the
son
of
the
eternal
father
and
the
savior
of
the
world
and
that
all
men
must
come
unto
him
or
they
cannot
be
saved
and
they
must
come
according
to
the
words
which
shall
be
established
by
the
mouth
of
the
lamb
and
the
words
of
the
lamb
shall
be
made
known
in
the
records
of
thy
seed
as
well
as
in
the
records
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
wherefore
they
both
shall
be
established
in
one
for
there
is
one
god
and
one
shepherd
over
all
the
earth
and
the
time
cometh
that
he
shall
manifest
himself
unto
all
nations
both
unto
the
jews
and
also
unto
the
gentiles
and
after
he
has
manifested
himself
unto
the
jews
and
also
unto
the
gentiles
then
he
shall
manifest
himself
unto
the
gentiles
and
also
unto
the
jews
and
the
last
shall
be
first
and
the
first
shall
be
last
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
if
the
gentiles
shall
hearken
unto
the
lamb
of
god
in
that
day
that
he
shall
manifest
himself
unto
them
in
word
and
also
in
power
in
very
deed
unto
the
taking
away
of
their
stumbling
blocks
and
harden
not
their
hearts
against
the
lamb
of
god
they
shall
be
numbered
among
the
seed
of
thy
father
yea
they
shall
be
numbered
among
the
house
of
Israel
and
they
shall
be
a
blessed
people
upon
the
promised
land
forever
they
shall
be
no
more
brought
down
into
captivity
and
the
house
of
Israel
shall
no
more
be
confounded
and
that
great
pit
which
hath
been
digged
for
them
by
that
great
and
abominable
church
which
was
founded
by
the
devil
and
his
children
that
he
might
lead
away
the
souls
of
men
down
to
hellyea
that
great
pit
which
hath
been
digged
for
the
destruction
of
men
shall
be
filled
by
those
who
digged
it
unto
their
utter
destruction
saith
the
lamb
of
god
not
the
destruction
of
the
soul
save
it
be
the
casting
of
it
into
that
hell
which
hath
no
end
for
behold
this
is
according
to
the
captivity
of
the
devil
and
also
according
to
the
justice
of
god
upon
all
those
who
will
work
wickedness
and
abomination
before
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
nephi
saying
thou
hast
beheld
that
if
the
gentiles
repent
it
shall
be
well
with
them
and
thou
also
knowest
concerning
the
covenants
of
the
lord
unto
the
house
of
Israel
and
thou
also
hast
heard
that
whoso
repenteth
not
must
perish
therefore
wo
be
unto
the
gentiles
if
it
so
be
that
they
harden
their
hearts
against
the
lamb
of
god
for
the
time
cometh
saith
the
lamb
of
god
that
I
will
work
a
great
and
a
marvelous
work
among
the
children
of
men
a
work
which
shall
be
everlasting
either
on
the
one
hand
or
on
the
othereither
to
the
convincing
of
them
unto
peace
and
life
eternal
or
unto
the
deliverance
of
them
to
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
the
blindness
of
their
minds
unto
their
being
brought
down
into
captivity
and
also
into
destruction
both
temporally
and
spiritually
according
to
the
captivity
of
the
devil
of
which
I
have
spoken
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
angel
had
spoken
these
words
he
said
unto
me
rememberest
thou
the
covenants
of
the
father
unto
the
house
of
Israel
I
said
unto
him
yea
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
me
look
and
behold
that
great
and
abominable
church
which
is
the
mother
of
abominations
whose
founder
is
the
devil
and
he
said
unto
me
behold
there
are
save
two
churches
only
the
one
is
the
church
of
the
lamb
of
god
and
the
other
is
the
church
of
the
devil
wherefore
whoso
belongeth
not
to
the
church
of
the
lamb
of
god
belongeth
to
that
great
church
which
is
the
mother
of
abominations
and
she
is
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
looked
and
beheld
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
and
she
sat
upon
many
waters
and
she
had
dominion
over
all
the
earth
among
all
nations
kindreds
tongues
and
people
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
the
church
of
the
lamb
of
god
and
its
numbers
were
few
because
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
the
whore
who
sat
upon
many
waters
nevertheless
I
beheld
that
the
church
of
the
lamb
who
were
the
saints
of
god
were
also
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
their
dominions
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
were
small
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
great
whore
whom
I
saw
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
that
the
great
mother
of
abominations
did
gather
together
multitudes
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
among
all
the
nations
of
the
gentiles
to
fight
against
the
lamb
of
god
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
beheld
the
power
of
the
lamb
of
god
that
it
descended
upon
the
saints
of
the
church
of
the
lamb
and
upon
the
covenant
people
of
the
lord
who
were
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
they
were
armed
with
righteousness
and
with
the
power
of
god
in
great
glory
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
that
the
wrath
of
god
was
poured
out
upon
that
great
and
abominable
church
insomuch
that
there
were
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
among
all
the
nations
and
kindreds
of
the
earth
and
as
there
began
to
be
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
among
all
the
nations
which
belonged
to
the
mother
of
abominations
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
the
wrath
of
god
is
upon
the
mother
of
harlots
and
behold
thou
seest
all
these
things
and
when
the
day
cometh
that
the
wrath
of
god
is
poured
out
upon
the
mother
of
harlots
which
is
the
great
and
abominable
church
of
all
the
earth
whose
founder
is
the
devil
then
at
that
day
the
work
of
the
father
shall
commence
in
preparing
the
way
for
the
fulfilling
of
his
covenants
which
he
hath
made
to
his
people
who
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
look
and
I
looked
and
beheld
a
man
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
white
robe
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
behold
one
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
lamb
behold
he
shall
see
and
write
the
remainder
of
these
things
yea
and
also
many
things
which
have
been
and
he
shall
also
write
concerning
the
end
of
the
world
wherefore
the
things
which
he
shall
write
are
just
and
true
and
behold
they
are
written
in
the
book
which
thou
beheld
proceeding
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
jew
and
at
the
time
they
proceeded
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
jew
or
at
the
time
the
book
proceeded
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
jew
the
things
which
were
written
were
plain
and
pure
and
most
precious
and
easy
to
the
understanding
of
all
men
and
behold
the
things
which
this
apostle
of
the
lamb
shall
write
are
many
things
which
thou
hast
seen
and
behold
the
remainder
shalt
thou
see
but
the
things
which
thou
shalt
see
hereafter
thou
shalt
not
write
for
the
lord
god
hath
ordained
the
apostle
of
the
lamb
of
god
that
he
should
write
them
and
also
others
who
have
been
to
them
hath
he
shown
all
things
and
they
have
written
them
and
they
are
sealed
up
to
come
forth
in
their
purity
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
the
lamb
in
the
own
due
time
of
the
lord
unto
the
house
of
Israel
and
I
nephi
heard
and
bear
record
that
the
name
of
the
apostle
of
the
lamb
was
john
according
to
the
word
of
the
angel
and
behold
I
nephi
am
forbidden
that
I
should
write
the
remainder
of
the
things
which
I
saw
and
heard
wherefore
the
things
which
I
have
written
sufficeth
me
and
I
have
written
but
a
small
part
of
the
things
which
I
saw
and
I
bear
record
that
I
saw
the
things
which
my
father
saw
and
the
angel
of
the
lord
did
make
them
known
unto
me
and
now
I
make
an
end
of
speaking
concerning
the
things
which
I
saw
while
I
was
carried
away
in
the
spirit
and
if
all
the
things
which
I
saw
are
not
written
the
things
which
I
have
written
are
true
and
thus
it
is
amen
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
nephi
had
been
carried
away
in
the
spirit
and
seen
all
these
things
I
returned
to
the
tent
of
my
father
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
my
brethren
and
they
were
disputing
one
with
another
concerning
the
things
my
father
had
spoken
unto
them
for
he
truly
spake
many
great
things
unto
them
which
were
hard
to
be
understood
save
a
man
should
inquire
of
the
lord
and
they
being
hard
in
their
hearts
therefore
they
did
not
look
unto
the
lord
as
they
ought
and
now
I
nephi
was
grieved
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
also
because
of
the
things
which
I
had
seen
and
knew
they
must
unavoidably
come
to
pass
because
of
the
great
wickedness
of
the
children
of
men
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
was
overcome
because
of
my
afflictions
for
I
considered
that
mine
afflictions
were
great
above
all
because
of
the
destruction
of
my
people
for
I
had
beheld
their
fall
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
had
received
strength
I
spake
unto
my
brethren
desiring
to
know
of
them
the
cause
of
their
disputations
and
they
said
behold
we
cannot
understand
the
words
which
our
father
hath
spoken
concerning
the
natural
branches
of
the
olivetree
and
also
concerning
the
gentiles
and
I
said
unto
them
have
ye
inquired
of
the
lord
and
they
said
unto
me
we
have
not
for
the
lord
maketh
no
such
thing
known
unto
us
behold
I
said
unto
them
how
is
it
that
ye
do
not
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
how
is
it
that
ye
will
perish
because
of
the
hardness
of
your
hearts
do
ye
not
remember
the
things
which
the
lord
hath
saidIf
ye
will
not
harden
your
hearts
and
ask
me
in
faith
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
with
diligence
in
keeping
my
commandments
surely
these
things
shall
be
made
known
unto
you
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
the
house
of
Israel
was
compared
unto
an
olivetree
by
the
spirit
of
the
lord
which
was
in
our
father
and
behold
are
we
not
broken
off
from
the
house
of
Israel
and
are
we
not
a
branch
of
the
house
of
Israel
and
now
the
thing
which
our
father
meaneth
concerning
the
grafting
in
of
the
natural
branches
through
the
fulness
of
the
gentiles
is
that
in
the
latter
days
when
our
seed
shall
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
yea
for
the
space
of
many
years
and
many
generations
after
the
messiah
shall
be
manifested
in
body
unto
the
children
of
men
then
shall
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
of
the
messiah
come
unto
the
gentiles
and
from
the
gentiles
unto
the
remnant
of
our
seed
and
at
that
day
shall
the
remnant
of
our
seed
know
that
they
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
and
that
they
are
the
covenant
people
of
the
lord
and
then
shall
they
know
and
come
to
the
knowledge
of
their
forefathers
and
also
to
the
knowledge
of
the
gospel
of
their
redeemer
which
was
ministered
unto
their
fathers
by
him
wherefore
they
shall
come
to
the
knowledge
of
their
redeemer
and
the
very
points
of
his
doctrine
that
they
may
know
how
to
come
unto
him
and
be
saved
and
then
at
that
day
will
they
not
rejoice
and
give
praise
unto
their
everlasting
god
their
rock
and
their
salvation
yea
at
that
day
will
they
not
receive
the
strength
and
nourishment
from
the
true
vine
yea
will
they
not
come
unto
the
true
fold
of
god
behold
I
say
unto
you
yea
they
shall
be
remembered
again
among
the
house
of
Israel
they
shall
be
grafted
in
being
a
natural
branch
of
the
olivetree
into
the
true
olivetree
and
this
is
what
our
father
meaneth
and
he
meaneth
that
it
will
not
come
to
pass
until
after
they
are
scattered
by
the
gentiles
and
he
meaneth
that
it
shall
come
by
way
of
the
gentiles
that
the
lord
may
show
his
power
unto
the
gentiles
for
the
very
cause
that
he
shall
be
rejected
of
the
jews
or
of
the
house
of
Israel
wherefore
our
father
hath
not
spoken
of
our
seed
alone
but
also
of
all
the
house
of
Israel
pointing
to
the
covenant
which
should
be
fulfilled
in
the
latter
days
which
covenant
the
lord
made
to
our
father
abraham
saying
In
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
spake
much
unto
them
concerning
these
things
yea
I
spake
unto
them
concerning
the
restoration
of
the
jews
in
the
latter
days
and
I
did
rehearse
unto
them
the
words
of
Isaiah
who
spake
concerning
the
restoration
of
the
jews
or
of
the
house
of
Israel
and
after
they
were
restored
they
should
no
more
be
confounded
neither
should
they
be
scattered
again
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
speak
many
words
unto
my
brethren
that
they
were
pacified
and
did
humble
themselves
before
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
speak
unto
me
again
saying
what
meaneth
this
thing
which
our
father
saw
in
a
dream
what
meaneth
the
tree
which
he
saw
and
I
said
unto
them
It
was
a
representation
of
the
tree
of
life
and
they
said
unto
me
what
meaneth
the
rod
of
iron
which
our
father
saw
that
led
to
the
tree
and
I
said
unto
them
that
it
was
the
word
of
god
and
whose
would
hearken
unto
the
word
of
god
and
would
hold
fast
unto
it
they
would
never
perish
neither
could
the
temptations
and
the
fiery
darts
of
the
adversary
overpower
them
unto
blindness
to
lead
them
away
to
destruction
wherefore
I
nephi
did
exhort
them
to
give
heed
unto
the
word
of
the
lord
yea
I
did
exhort
them
with
all
the
energies
of
my
soul
and
with
all
the
faculty
which
I
possessed
that
they
would
give
heed
to
the
word
of
god
and
remember
to
keep
his
commandments
always
in
all
things
and
they
said
unto
me
what
meaneth
the
river
of
water
which
our
father
saw
and
I
said
unto
them
that
the
water
which
my
father
saw
was
filthiness
and
so
much
was
his
mind
swallowed
up
in
other
things
that
he
beheld
not
the
filthiness
of
the
water
and
I
said
unto
them
that
it
was
an
awful
gulf
which
separated
the
wicked
from
the
tree
of
life
and
also
from
the
saints
of
god
and
I
said
unto
them
that
it
was
a
representation
of
that
awful
hell
which
the
angel
said
unto
me
was
prepared
for
the
wicked
and
I
said
unto
them
that
our
father
also
saw
that
the
justice
of
god
did
also
divide
the
wicked
from
the
righteous
and
the
brightness
thereof
was
like
unto
the
brightness
of
a
flaming
fire
which
ascendeth
up
unto
god
forever
and
ever
and
hath
no
end
and
they
said
unto
me
doth
this
thing
mean
the
torment
of
the
body
in
the
days
of
probation
or
doth
it
mean
the
final
state
of
the
soul
after
the
death
of
the
temporal
body
or
doth
it
speak
of
the
things
which
are
temporal
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
said
unto
them
that
it
was
a
representation
of
things
both
temporal
and
spiritual
for
the
day
should
come
that
they
must
be
judged
of
their
works
yea
even
the
works
which
were
done
by
the
temporal
body
in
their
days
of
probation
wherefore
if
they
should
die
in
their
wickedness
they
must
be
cast
off
also
as
to
the
things
which
are
spiritual
which
are
pertaining
to
righteousness
wherefore
they
must
be
brought
to
stand
before
god
to
be
judged
of
their
works
and
if
their
works
have
been
filthiness
they
must
needs
be
filthy
and
if
they
be
filthy
it
must
needs
be
that
they
cannot
dwell
in
the
kingdom
of
god
if
so
the
kingdom
of
god
must
be
filthy
also
but
behold
I
say
unto
you
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
filthy
and
there
cannot
any
unclean
thing
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
wherefore
there
must
needs
be
a
place
of
filthiness
prepared
for
that
which
is
filthy
and
there
is
a
place
prepared
yea
even
that
awful
hell
of
which
I
have
spoken
and
the
devil
is
the
preparator
of
it
wherefore
the
final
state
of
the
souls
of
men
is
to
dwell
in
the
kingdom
of
god
or
to
be
cast
out
because
of
that
justice
of
which
I
have
spoken
wherefore
the
wicked
are
rejected
from
the
righteous
and
also
from
that
tree
of
life
whose
fruit
is
most
precious
and
most
desirable
above
all
other
fruits
yea
and
it
is
the
greatest
of
all
the
gifts
of
god
and
thus
I
spake
unto
my
brethren
amen
and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
nephi
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
to
my
brethren
behold
they
said
unto
me
thou
hast
declared
unto
us
hard
things
more
than
we
are
able
to
bear
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
said
unto
them
that
I
knew
that
I
had
spoken
hard
things
against
the
wicked
according
to
the
truth
and
the
righteous
have
I
justified
and
testified
that
they
should
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
wherefore
the
guilty
taketh
the
truth
to
be
hard
for
it
cutteth
them
to
the
very
center
and
now
my
brethren
if
ye
were
righteous
and
were
willing
to
hearken
to
the
truth
and
give
heed
unto
it
that
ye
might
walk
uprightly
before
god
then
ye
would
not
murmur
because
of
the
truth
and
say
thou
speakest
hard
things
against
us
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
exhort
my
brethren
with
all
diligence
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
humble
themselves
before
the
lord
insomuch
that
I
had
joy
and
great
hopes
of
them
that
they
would
walk
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
now
all
these
things
were
said
and
done
as
my
father
dwelt
in
a
tent
in
the
valley
which
he
called
lemuel
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
took
one
of
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
to
wife
and
also
my
brethren
took
of
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
to
wife
and
also
zoram
took
the
eldest
daughter
of
Ishmael
to
wife
and
thus
my
father
had
fulfilled
all
the
commandments
of
the
lord
which
had
been
given
unto
him
and
also
I
nephi
had
been
blessed
of
the
lord
exceedingly
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
spake
unto
my
father
by
night
and
commanded
him
that
on
the
morrow
he
should
take
his
journey
into
the
wilderness
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
my
father
arose
in
the
morning
and
went
forth
to
the
tent
door
to
his
great
astonishment
he
beheld
upon
the
ground
a
round
ball
of
curious
workmanship
and
it
was
of
fine
brass
and
within
the
ball
were
two
spindles
and
the
one
pointed
the
way
whither
we
should
go
into
the
wilderness
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
gather
together
whatsoever
things
we
should
carry
into
the
wilderness
and
all
the
remainder
of
our
provisions
which
the
lord
had
given
unto
us
and
we
did
take
seed
of
every
kind
that
we
might
carry
into
the
wilderness
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
take
our
tents
and
depart
into
the
wilderness
across
the
river
laman
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
traveled
for
the
space
of
four
days
nearly
a
southsoutheast
direction
and
we
did
pitch
our
tents
again
and
we
did
call
the
name
of
the
place
shazer
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
take
our
bows
and
our
arrows
and
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
to
slay
food
for
our
families
and
after
we
had
slain
food
for
our
families
we
did
return
again
to
our
families
in
the
wilderness
to
the
place
of
shazer
and
we
did
go
forth
again
in
the
wilderness
following
the
same
direction
keeping
in
the
most
fertile
parts
of
the
wilderness
which
were
in
the
borders
near
the
red
sea
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
travel
for
the
space
of
many
days
slaying
food
by
the
way
with
our
bows
and
our
arrows
and
our
stones
and
our
slings
and
we
did
follow
the
directions
of
the
ball
which
led
us
in
the
more
fertile
parts
of
the
wilderness
and
after
we
had
traveled
for
the
space
of
many
days
we
did
pitch
our
tents
for
the
space
of
a
time
that
we
might
again
rest
ourselves
and
obtain
food
for
our
families
and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
I
nephi
went
forth
to
slay
food
behold
I
did
break
my
bow
which
was
made
of
fine
steel
and
after
I
did
break
my
bow
behold
my
brethren
were
angry
with
me
because
of
the
loss
of
my
bow
for
we
did
obtain
no
food
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
return
without
food
to
our
families
and
being
much
fatigued
because
of
their
journeying
they
did
suffer
much
for
the
want
of
food
and
it
came
to
pass
that
laman
and
lemuel
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
did
begin
to
murmur
exceedingly
because
of
their
sufferings
and
afflictions
in
the
wilderness
and
also
my
father
began
to
murmur
against
the
lord
his
god
yea
and
they
were
all
exceedingly
sorrowful
even
that
they
did
murmur
against
the
lord
now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
having
been
afflicted
with
my
brethren
because
of
the
loss
of
my
bow
and
their
bows
having
lost
their
springs
it
began
to
be
exceedingly
difficult
yea
insomuch
that
we
could
obtain
no
food
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
speak
much
unto
my
brethren
because
they
had
hardened
their
hearts
again
even
unto
complaining
against
the
lord
their
god
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
make
out
of
wood
a
bow
and
out
of
a
straight
stick
an
arrow
wherefore
I
did
arm
myself
with
a
bow
and
an
arrow
with
a
sling
and
with
stones
and
I
said
unto
my
father
whither
shall
I
go
to
obtain
food
and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
inquire
of
the
lord
for
they
had
humbled
themselves
because
of
my
words
for
I
did
say
many
things
unto
them
in
the
energy
of
my
soul
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
my
father
and
he
was
truly
chastened
because
of
his
murmuring
against
the
lord
insomuch
that
he
was
brought
down
into
the
depths
of
sorrow
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
said
unto
him
look
upon
the
ball
and
behold
the
things
which
are
written
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
beheld
the
things
which
were
written
upon
the
ball
he
did
fear
and
tremble
exceedingly
and
also
my
brethren
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
and
our
wives
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
beheld
the
pointers
which
were
in
the
ball
that
they
did
work
according
to
the
faith
and
diligence
and
heed
which
we
did
give
unto
them
and
there
was
also
written
upon
them
a
new
writing
which
was
plain
to
be
read
which
did
give
us
understanding
concerning
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
it
was
written
and
changed
from
time
to
time
according
to
the
faith
and
diligence
which
we
gave
unto
it
and
thus
we
see
that
by
small
means
the
lord
can
bring
about
great
things
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
go
forth
up
into
the
top
of
the
mountain
according
to
the
directions
which
were
given
upon
the
ball
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
slay
wild
beasts
insomuch
that
I
did
obtain
food
for
our
families
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
return
to
our
tents
bearing
the
beasts
which
I
had
slain
and
now
when
they
beheld
that
I
had
obtained
food
how
great
was
their
joy
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
humble
themselves
before
the
lord
and
did
give
thanks
unto
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
again
take
our
journey
traveling
nearly
the
same
course
as
in
the
beginning
and
after
we
had
traveled
for
the
space
of
many
days
we
did
pitch
our
tents
again
that
we
might
tarry
for
the
space
of
a
time
and
it
came
to
pass
that
Ishmael
died
and
was
buried
in
the
place
which
was
called
nahom
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
did
mourn
exceedingly
because
of
the
loss
of
their
father
and
because
of
their
afflictions
in
the
wilderness
and
they
did
murmur
against
my
father
because
he
had
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
saying
our
father
is
dead
yea
and
we
have
wandered
much
in
the
wilderness
and
we
have
suffered
much
affliction
hunger
thirst
and
fatigue
and
after
all
these
sufferings
we
must
perish
in
the
wilderness
with
hunger
and
thus
they
did
murmur
against
my
father
and
also
against
me
and
they
were
desirous
to
return
again
to
jerusalem
and
laman
said
unto
lemuel
and
also
unto
the
sons
of
Ishmael
behold
let
us
slay
our
father
and
also
our
brother
nephi
who
has
taken
it
upon
him
to
be
our
ruler
and
our
teacher
who
are
his
elder
brethren
now
he
says
that
the
lord
has
talked
with
him
and
also
that
angels
have
ministered
unto
him
but
behold
we
know
that
he
lies
unto
us
and
he
tells
us
these
things
and
he
worketh
many
things
by
his
cunning
arts
that
he
may
deceive
our
eyes
thinking
perhaps
that
he
may
lead
us
away
into
some
strange
wilderness
and
after
he
has
led
us
away
he
has
thought
to
make
himself
a
king
and
a
ruler
over
us
that
he
may
do
with
us
according
to
his
will
and
pleasure
and
after
this
manner
did
my
brother
laman
stir
up
their
hearts
to
anger
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
was
with
us
yea
even
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
and
did
speak
many
words
unto
them
and
did
chasten
them
exceedingly
and
after
they
were
chastened
by
the
voice
of
the
lord
they
did
turn
away
their
anger
and
did
repent
of
their
sins
insomuch
that
the
lord
did
bless
us
again
with
food
that
we
did
not
perish
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
again
take
our
journey
in
the
wilderness
and
we
did
travel
nearly
eastward
from
that
time
forth
and
we
did
travel
and
wade
through
much
affliction
in
the
wilderness
and
our
women
did
bear
children
in
the
wilderness
and
so
great
were
the
blessings
of
the
lord
upon
us
that
while
we
did
live
upon
raw
meat
in
the
wilderness
our
women
did
give
plenty
of
suck
for
their
children
and
were
strong
yea
even
like
unto
the
men
and
they
began
to
bear
their
journeyings
without
murmurings
and
thus
we
see
that
the
commandments
of
god
must
be
fulfilled
and
if
it
so
be
that
the
children
of
men
keep
the
commandments
of
god
he
doth
nourish
them
and
strengthen
them
and
provide
means
whereby
they
can
accomplish
the
thing
which
he
has
commanded
them
wherefore
he
did
provide
means
for
us
while
we
did
sojourn
in
the
wilderness
and
we
did
sojourn
for
the
space
of
many
years
yea
even
eight
years
in
the
wilderness
and
we
did
come
to
the
land
which
we
called
bountiful
because
of
its
much
fruit
and
also
wild
honey
and
all
these
things
were
prepared
of
the
lord
that
we
might
not
perish
and
we
beheld
the
sea
which
we
called
Irreantum
which
being
interpreted
is
many
waters
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
pitch
our
tents
by
the
seashore
and
notwithstanding
we
had
suffered
many
afflictions
and
much
difficulty
yea
even
so
much
that
we
cannot
write
them
all
we
were
exceedingly
rejoiced
when
we
came
to
the
seashore
and
we
called
the
place
bountiful
because
of
its
much
fruit
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
nephi
had
been
in
the
land
of
bountiful
for
the
space
of
many
days
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
me
saying
arise
and
get
thee
into
the
mountain
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
arose
and
went
up
into
the
mountain
and
cried
unto
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
thou
shalt
construct
a
ship
after
the
manner
which
I
shall
show
thee
that
I
may
carry
thy
people
across
these
waters
and
I
said
lord
whither
shall
I
go
that
I
may
find
ore
to
molten
that
I
may
make
tools
to
construct
the
ship
after
the
manner
which
thou
hast
shown
unto
me
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
told
me
whither
I
should
go
to
find
ore
that
I
might
make
tools
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
make
a
bellows
wherewith
to
blow
the
fire
of
the
skins
of
beasts
and
after
I
had
made
a
bellows
that
I
might
have
wherewith
to
blow
the
fire
I
did
smite
two
stones
together
that
I
might
make
fire
for
the
lord
had
not
hitherto
suffered
that
we
should
make
much
fire
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
for
he
said
I
will
make
thy
food
become
sweet
that
ye
cook
it
not
and
I
will
also
be
your
light
in
the
wilderness
and
I
will
prepare
the
way
before
you
if
it
so
be
that
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
wherefore
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
be
led
towards
the
promised
land
and
ye
shall
know
that
it
is
by
me
that
ye
are
led
yea
and
the
lord
said
also
that
after
ye
have
arrived
in
the
promised
land
ye
shall
know
that
I
the
lord
am
god
and
that
I
the
lord
did
deliver
you
from
destruction
yea
that
I
did
bring
you
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
wherefore
I
nephi
did
strive
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
I
did
exhort
my
brethren
to
faithfulness
and
diligence
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
make
tools
of
the
ore
which
I
did
molten
out
of
the
rock
and
when
my
brethren
saw
that
I
was
about
to
build
a
ship
they
began
to
murmur
against
me
saying
our
brother
is
a
fool
for
he
thinketh
that
he
can
build
a
ship
yea
and
he
also
thinketh
that
he
can
cross
these
great
waters
and
thus
my
brethren
did
complain
against
me
and
were
desirous
that
they
might
not
labor
for
they
did
not
believe
that
I
could
build
a
ship
neither
would
they
believe
that
I
was
instructed
of
the
lord
and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
was
exceedingly
sorrowful
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
now
when
they
saw
that
I
began
to
be
sorrowful
they
were
glad
in
their
hearts
insomuch
that
they
did
rejoice
over
me
saying
we
knew
that
ye
could
not
construct
a
ship
for
we
knew
that
ye
were
lacking
in
judgment
wherefore
thou
canst
not
accomplish
so
great
a
work
and
thou
art
like
unto
our
father
led
away
by
the
foolish
imaginations
of
his
heart
yea
he
hath
led
us
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
we
have
wandered
in
the
wilderness
for
these
many
years
and
our
women
have
toiled
being
big
with
child
and
they
have
borne
children
in
the
wilderness
and
suffered
all
things
save
it
were
death
and
it
would
have
been
better
that
they
had
died
before
they
came
out
of
jerusalem
than
to
have
suffered
these
afflictions
behold
these
many
years
we
have
suffered
in
the
wilderness
which
time
we
might
have
enjoyed
our
possessions
and
the
land
of
our
inheritance
yea
and
we
might
have
been
happy
and
we
know
that
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
jerusalem
were
a
righteous
people
for
they
kept
the
statutes
and
judgments
of
the
lord
and
all
his
commandments
according
to
the
law
of
moses
wherefore
we
know
that
they
are
a
righteous
people
and
our
father
hath
judged
them
and
hath
led
us
away
because
we
would
hearken
unto
his
words
yea
and
our
brother
is
like
unto
him
and
after
this
manner
of
language
did
my
brethren
murmur
and
complain
against
us
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
spake
unto
them
saying
do
ye
believe
that
our
fathers
who
were
the
children
of
Israel
would
have
been
led
away
out
of
the
hands
of
the
egyptians
if
they
had
not
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
the
lord
yea
do
ye
suppose
that
they
would
have
been
led
out
of
bondage
if
the
lord
had
not
commanded
moses
that
he
should
lead
them
out
of
bondage
now
ye
know
that
the
children
of
Israel
were
in
bondage
and
ye
know
that
they
were
laden
with
tasks
which
were
grievous
to
be
borne
wherefore
ye
know
that
it
must
needs
be
a
good
thing
for
them
that
they
should
be
brought
out
of
bondage
now
ye
know
that
moses
was
commanded
of
the
lord
to
do
that
great
work
and
ye
know
that
by
his
word
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
were
divided
hither
and
thither
and
they
passed
through
on
dry
ground
but
ye
know
that
the
egyptians
were
drowned
in
the
red
sea
who
were
the
armies
of
pharaoh
and
ye
also
know
that
they
were
fed
with
manna
in
the
wilderness
yea
and
ye
also
know
that
moses
by
his
word
according
to
the
power
of
god
which
was
in
him
smote
the
rock
and
there
came
forth
water
that
the
children
of
Israel
might
quench
their
thirst
and
notwithstanding
they
being
led
the
lord
their
god
their
redeemer
going
before
them
leading
them
by
day
and
giving
light
unto
them
by
night
and
doing
all
things
for
them
which
were
expedient
for
man
to
receive
they
hardened
their
hearts
and
blinded
their
minds
and
reviled
against
moses
and
against
the
true
and
living
god
and
it
came
to
pass
that
according
to
his
word
he
did
destroy
them
and
according
to
his
word
he
did
lead
them
and
according
to
his
word
he
did
do
all
things
for
them
and
there
was
not
any
thing
done
save
it
were
by
his
word
and
after
they
had
crossed
the
river
jordan
he
did
make
them
mighty
unto
the
driving
out
of
the
children
of
the
land
yea
unto
the
scattering
them
to
destruction
and
now
do
ye
suppose
that
the
children
of
this
land
who
were
in
the
land
of
promise
who
were
driven
out
by
our
fathers
do
ye
suppose
that
they
were
righteous
behold
I
say
unto
you
nay
do
ye
suppose
that
our
fathers
would
have
been
more
choice
than
they
if
they
had
been
righteous
I
say
unto
you
nay
behold
the
lord
esteemeth
all
flesh
in
one
he
that
is
righteous
is
favored
of
god
but
behold
this
people
had
rejected
every
word
of
god
and
they
were
ripe
in
iniquity
and
the
fulness
of
the
wrath
of
god
was
upon
them
and
the
lord
did
curse
the
land
against
them
and
bless
it
unto
our
fathers
yea
he
did
curse
it
against
them
unto
their
destruction
and
he
did
bless
it
unto
our
fathers
unto
their
obtaining
power
over
it
behold
the
lord
hath
created
the
earth
that
it
should
be
inhabited
and
he
hath
created
his
children
that
they
should
possess
it
and
he
raiseth
up
a
righteous
nation
and
destroyeth
the
nations
of
the
wicked
and
he
leadeth
away
the
righteous
into
precious
lands
and
the
wicked
he
destroyeth
and
curseth
the
land
unto
them
for
their
sakes
he
ruleth
high
in
the
heavens
for
it
is
his
throne
and
this
earth
is
his
footstool
and
he
loveth
those
who
will
have
him
to
be
their
god
behold
he
loved
our
fathers
and
he
covenanted
with
them
yea
even
abraham
Isaac
and
jacob
and
he
remembered
the
covenants
which
he
had
made
wherefore
he
did
bring
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
he
did
straiten
them
in
the
wilderness
with
his
rod
for
they
hardened
their
hearts
even
as
ye
have
and
the
lord
straitened
them
because
of
their
iniquity
he
sent
fiery
flying
serpents
among
them
and
after
they
were
bitten
he
prepared
a
way
that
they
might
be
healed
and
the
labor
which
they
had
to
perform
was
to
look
and
because
of
the
simpleness
of
the
way
or
the
easiness
of
it
there
were
many
who
perished
and
they
did
harden
their
hearts
from
time
to
time
and
they
did
revile
against
moses
and
also
against
god
nevertheless
ye
know
that
they
were
led
forth
by
his
matchless
power
into
the
land
of
promise
and
now
after
all
these
things
the
time
has
come
that
they
have
become
wicked
yea
nearly
unto
ripeness
and
I
know
not
but
they
are
at
this
day
about
to
be
destroyed
for
I
know
that
the
day
must
surely
come
that
they
must
be
destroyed
save
a
few
only
who
shall
be
led
away
into
captivity
wherefore
the
lord
commanded
my
father
that
he
should
depart
into
the
wilderness
and
the
jews
also
sought
to
take
away
his
life
yea
and
ye
also
have
sought
to
take
away
his
life
wherefore
ye
are
murderers
in
your
hearts
and
ye
are
like
unto
them
ye
are
swift
to
do
iniquity
but
slow
to
remember
the
lord
your
god
ye
have
seen
an
angel
and
he
spake
unto
you
yea
ye
have
heard
his
voice
from
time
to
time
and
he
hath
spoken
unto
you
in
a
still
small
voice
but
ye
were
past
feeling
that
ye
could
not
feel
his
words
wherefore
he
has
spoken
unto
you
like
unto
the
voice
of
thunder
which
did
cause
the
earth
to
shake
as
if
it
were
to
divide
asunder
and
ye
also
know
that
by
the
power
of
his
almighty
word
he
can
cause
the
earth
that
it
shall
pass
away
yea
and
ye
know
that
by
his
word
he
can
cause
the
rough
places
to
be
made
smooth
and
smooth
places
shall
be
broken
up
o
then
why
is
it
that
ye
can
be
so
hard
in
your
hearts
behold
my
soul
is
rent
with
anguish
because
of
you
and
my
heart
is
pained
I
fear
lest
ye
shall
be
cast
off
forever
behold
I
am
full
of
the
spirit
of
god
insomuch
that
my
frame
has
no
strength
and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
had
spoken
these
words
they
were
angry
with
me
and
were
desirous
to
throw
me
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
as
they
came
forth
to
lay
their
hands
upon
me
I
spake
unto
them
saying
In
the
name
of
the
almighty
god
I
command
you
that
ye
touch
me
not
for
I
am
filled
with
the
power
of
god
even
unto
the
consuming
of
my
flesh
and
whoso
shall
lay
his
hands
upon
me
shall
wither
even
as
a
dried
reed
and
he
shall
be
as
naught
before
the
power
of
god
for
god
shall
smite
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
said
unto
them
that
they
should
murmur
no
more
against
their
father
neither
should
they
withhold
their
labor
from
me
for
god
had
commanded
me
that
I
should
build
a
ship
and
I
said
unto
them
If
god
had
commanded
me
to
do
all
things
I
could
do
them
If
he
should
command
me
that
I
should
say
unto
this
water
be
thou
earth
it
should
be
earth
and
if
I
should
say
it
it
would
be
done
and
now
if
the
lord
has
such
great
power
and
has
wrought
so
many
miracles
among
the
children
of
men
how
is
it
that
he
cannot
instruct
me
that
I
should
build
a
ship
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
said
many
things
unto
my
brethren
insomuch
that
they
were
confounded
and
could
not
contend
against
me
neither
durst
they
lay
their
hands
upon
me
nor
touch
me
with
their
fingers
even
for
the
space
of
many
days
now
they
durst
not
do
this
lest
they
should
wither
before
me
so
powerful
was
the
spirit
of
god
and
thus
it
had
wrought
upon
them
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
said
unto
me
stretch
forth
thine
hand
again
unto
thy
brethren
and
they
shall
not
wither
before
thee
but
I
will
shock
them
saith
the
lord
and
this
will
I
do
that
they
may
know
that
I
am
the
lord
their
god
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
stretched
forth
my
hand
unto
my
brethren
and
they
did
not
wither
before
me
but
the
lord
did
shake
them
even
according
to
the
word
which
he
had
spoken
and
now
they
said
we
know
of
a
surety
that
the
lord
is
with
thee
for
we
know
that
it
is
the
power
of
the
lord
that
has
shaken
us
and
they
fell
down
before
me
and
were
about
to
worship
me
but
I
would
not
suffer
them
saying
I
am
thy
brother
yea
even
thy
younger
brother
wherefore
worship
the
lord
thy
god
and
honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
that
thy
days
may
be
long
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
shall
give
thee
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
worship
the
lord
and
did
go
forth
with
me
and
we
did
work
timbers
of
curious
workmanship
and
the
lord
did
show
me
from
time
to
time
after
what
manner
I
should
work
the
timbers
of
the
ship
now
I
nephi
did
not
work
the
timbers
after
the
manner
which
was
learned
by
men
neither
did
I
build
the
ship
after
the
manner
of
men
but
I
did
build
it
after
the
manner
which
the
lord
had
shown
unto
me
wherefore
it
was
not
after
the
manner
of
men
and
I
nephi
did
go
into
the
mount
oft
and
I
did
pray
oft
unto
the
lord
wherefore
the
lord
showed
unto
me
great
things
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
had
finished
the
ship
according
to
the
word
of
the
lord
my
brethren
beheld
that
it
was
good
and
that
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceedingly
fine
wherefore
they
did
humble
themselves
again
before
the
lord
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
my
father
that
we
should
arise
and
go
down
into
the
ship
and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
after
we
had
prepared
all
things
much
fruits
and
meat
from
the
wilderness
and
honey
in
abundance
and
provisions
according
to
that
which
the
lord
had
commanded
us
we
did
go
down
into
the
ship
with
all
our
loading
and
our
seeds
and
whatsoever
thing
we
had
brought
with
us
every
one
according
to
his
age
wherefore
we
did
all
go
down
into
the
ship
with
our
wives
and
our
children
and
now
my
father
had
begat
two
sons
in
the
wilderness
the
elder
was
called
jacob
and
the
younger
joseph
and
it
came
to
pass
after
we
had
all
gone
down
into
the
ship
and
had
taken
with
us
our
provisions
and
things
which
had
been
commanded
us
we
did
put
forth
into
the
sea
and
were
driven
forth
before
the
wind
towards
the
promised
land
and
after
we
had
been
driven
forth
before
the
wind
for
the
space
of
many
days
behold
my
brethren
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
and
also
their
wives
began
to
make
themselves
merry
insomuch
that
they
began
to
dance
and
to
sing
and
to
speak
with
much
rudeness
yea
even
that
they
did
forget
by
what
power
they
had
been
brought
thither
yea
they
were
lifted
up
unto
exceeding
rudeness
and
I
nephi
began
to
fear
exceedingly
lest
the
lord
should
be
angry
with
us
and
smite
us
because
of
our
iniquity
that
we
should
be
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
wherefore
I
nephi
began
to
speak
to
them
with
much
soberness
but
behold
they
were
angry
with
me
saying
we
will
not
that
our
younger
brother
shall
be
a
ruler
over
us
and
it
came
to
pass
that
laman
and
lemuel
did
take
me
and
bind
me
with
cords
and
they
did
treat
me
with
much
harshness
nevertheless
the
lord
did
suffer
it
that
he
might
show
forth
his
power
unto
the
fulfilling
of
his
word
which
he
had
spoken
concerning
the
wicked
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
bound
me
insomuch
that
I
could
not
move
the
compass
which
had
been
prepared
of
the
lord
did
cease
to
work
wherefore
they
knew
not
whither
they
should
steer
the
ship
insomuch
that
there
arose
a
great
storm
yea
a
great
and
terrible
tempest
and
we
were
driven
back
upon
the
waters
for
the
space
of
three
days
and
they
began
to
be
frightened
exceedingly
lest
they
should
be
drowned
in
the
sea
nevertheless
they
did
not
loose
me
and
on
the
fourth
day
which
we
had
been
driven
back
the
tempest
began
to
be
exceedingly
sore
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
were
about
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
after
we
had
been
driven
back
upon
the
waters
for
the
space
of
four
days
my
brethren
began
to
see
that
the
judgments
of
god
were
upon
them
and
that
they
must
perish
save
that
they
should
repent
of
their
iniquities
wherefore
they
came
unto
me
and
loosed
the
bands
which
were
upon
my
wrist
and
behold
they
had
swollen
exceedingly
and
also
mine
ankles
were
much
swollen
and
great
was
the
soreness
thereof
nevertheless
I
did
look
unto
my
god
and
I
did
praise
him
all
the
day
long
and
I
did
not
murmur
against
the
lord
because
of
mine
afflictions
now
my
father
lehi
had
said
many
things
unto
them
and
also
unto
the
sons
of
Ishmael
but
behold
they
did
breathe
out
much
threatenings
against
anyone
that
should
speak
for
me
and
my
parents
being
stricken
in
years
and
having
suffered
much
grief
because
of
their
children
they
were
brought
down
yea
even
upon
their
sickbeds
because
of
their
grief
and
much
sorrow
and
the
iniquity
of
my
brethren
they
were
brought
near
even
to
be
carried
out
of
this
time
to
meet
their
god
yea
their
grey
hairs
were
about
to
be
brought
down
to
lie
low
in
the
dust
yea
even
they
were
near
to
be
cast
with
sorrow
into
a
watery
grave
and
jacob
and
joseph
also
being
young
having
need
of
much
nourishment
were
grieved
because
of
the
afflictions
of
their
mother
and
also
my
wife
with
her
tears
and
prayers
and
also
my
children
did
not
soften
the
hearts
of
my
brethren
that
they
would
loose
me
and
there
was
nothing
save
it
were
the
power
of
god
which
threatened
them
with
destruction
could
soften
their
hearts
wherefore
when
they
saw
that
they
were
about
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
they
repented
of
the
thing
which
they
had
done
insomuch
that
they
loosed
me
and
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
loosed
me
behold
I
took
the
compass
and
it
did
work
whither
I
desired
it
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
after
I
had
prayed
the
winds
did
cease
and
the
storm
did
cease
and
there
was
a
great
calm
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
guide
the
ship
that
we
sailed
again
towards
the
promised
land
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
sailed
for
the
space
of
many
days
we
did
arrive
at
the
promised
land
and
we
went
forth
upon
the
land
and
did
pitch
our
tents
and
we
did
call
it
the
promised
land
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
begin
to
till
the
earth
and
we
began
to
plant
seeds
yea
we
did
put
all
our
seeds
into
the
earth
which
we
had
brought
from
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
grow
exceedingly
wherefore
we
were
blessed
in
abundance
and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
find
upon
the
land
of
promise
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
that
there
were
beasts
in
the
forests
of
every
kind
both
the
cow
and
the
ox
and
the
ass
and
the
horse
and
the
goat
and
the
wild
goat
and
all
manner
of
wild
animals
which
were
for
the
use
of
men
and
we
did
find
all
manner
of
ore
both
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
of
copper
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
commanded
me
wherefore
I
did
make
plates
of
ore
that
I
might
engraven
upon
them
the
record
of
my
people
and
upon
the
plates
which
I
made
I
did
engraven
the
record
of
my
father
and
also
our
journeyings
in
the
wilderness
and
the
prophecies
of
my
father
and
also
many
of
mine
own
prophecies
have
I
engraven
upon
them
and
I
knew
not
at
the
time
when
I
made
them
that
I
should
be
commanded
of
the
lord
to
make
these
plates
wherefore
the
record
of
my
father
and
the
genealogy
of
his
fathers
and
the
more
part
of
all
our
proceedings
in
the
wilderness
are
engraven
upon
those
first
plates
of
which
I
have
spoken
wherefore
the
things
which
transpired
before
I
made
these
plates
are
of
a
truth
more
particularly
made
mention
upon
the
first
plates
and
after
I
had
made
these
plates
by
way
of
commandment
I
nephi
received
a
commandment
that
the
ministry
and
the
prophecies
the
more
plain
and
precious
parts
of
them
should
be
written
upon
these
plates
and
that
the
things
which
were
written
should
be
kept
for
the
instruction
of
my
people
who
should
possess
the
land
and
also
for
other
wise
purposes
which
purposes
are
known
unto
the
lord
wherefore
I
nephi
did
make
a
record
upon
the
other
plates
which
gives
an
account
or
which
gives
a
greater
account
of
the
wars
and
contentions
and
destructions
of
my
people
and
this
have
I
done
and
commanded
my
people
what
they
should
do
after
I
was
gone
and
that
these
plates
should
be
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
or
from
one
prophet
to
another
until
further
commandments
of
the
lord
and
an
account
of
my
making
these
plates
shall
be
given
hereafter
and
then
behold
I
proceed
according
to
that
which
I
have
spoken
and
this
I
do
that
the
more
sacred
things
may
be
kept
for
the
knowledge
of
my
people
nevertheless
I
do
not
write
anything
upon
plates
save
it
be
that
I
think
it
be
sacred
and
now
if
I
do
err
even
did
they
err
of
old
not
that
I
would
excuse
myself
because
of
other
men
but
because
of
the
weakness
which
is
in
me
according
to
the
flesh
I
would
excuse
myself
for
the
things
which
some
men
esteem
to
be
of
great
worth
both
to
the
body
and
soul
others
set
at
naught
and
trample
under
their
feet
yea
even
the
very
god
of
Israel
do
men
trample
under
their
feet
I
say
trample
under
their
feet
but
I
would
speak
in
other
wordsthey
set
him
at
naught
and
hearken
not
to
the
voice
of
his
counsels
and
behold
he
cometh
according
to
the
words
of
the
angel
in
six
hundred
years
from
the
time
my
father
left
jerusalem
and
the
world
because
of
their
iniquity
shall
judge
him
to
be
a
thing
of
naught
wherefore
they
scourge
him
and
he
suffereth
it
and
they
smite
him
and
he
suffereth
it
yea
they
spit
upon
him
and
he
suffereth
it
because
of
his
loving
kindness
and
his
longsuffering
towards
the
children
of
men
and
the
god
of
our
fathers
who
were
led
out
of
egypt
out
of
bondage
and
also
were
preserved
in
the
wilderness
by
him
yea
the
god
of
abraham
and
of
Isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
yieldeth
himself
according
to
the
words
of
the
angel
as
a
man
into
the
hands
of
wicked
men
to
be
lifted
up
according
to
the
words
of
zenock
and
to
be
crucified
according
to
the
words
of
neum
and
to
be
buried
in
a
sepulchre
according
to
the
words
of
zenos
which
he
spake
concerning
the
three
days
of
darkness
which
should
be
a
sign
given
of
his
death
unto
those
who
should
inhabit
the
isles
of
the
sea
more
especially
given
unto
those
who
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
for
thus
spake
the
prophet
the
lord
god
surely
shall
visit
all
the
house
of
Israel
at
that
day
some
with
his
voice
because
of
their
righteousness
unto
their
great
joy
and
salvation
and
others
with
the
thunderings
and
the
lightnings
of
his
power
by
tempest
by
fire
and
by
smoke
and
vapor
of
darkness
and
by
the
opening
of
the
earth
and
by
mountains
which
shall
be
carried
up
and
all
these
things
must
surely
come
saith
the
prophet
zenos
and
the
rocks
of
the
earth
must
rend
and
because
of
the
groanings
of
the
earth
many
of
the
kings
of
the
isles
of
the
sea
shall
be
wrought
upon
by
the
spirit
of
god
to
exclaim
the
god
of
nature
suffers
and
as
for
those
who
are
at
jerusalem
saith
the
prophet
they
shall
be
scourged
by
all
people
because
they
crucify
the
god
of
Israel
and
turn
their
hearts
aside
rejecting
signs
and
wonders
and
the
power
and
glory
of
the
god
of
Israel
and
because
they
turn
their
hearts
aside
saith
the
prophet
and
have
despised
the
holy
one
of
Israel
they
shall
wander
in
the
flesh
and
perish
and
become
a
hiss
and
a
byword
and
be
hated
among
all
nations
nevertheless
when
that
day
cometh
saith
the
prophet
that
they
no
more
turn
aside
their
hearts
against
the
holy
one
of
Israel
then
will
he
remember
the
covenants
which
he
made
to
their
fathers
yea
then
will
he
remember
the
isles
of
the
sea
yea
and
all
the
people
who
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
will
I
gather
in
saith
the
lord
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophet
zenos
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
yea
and
all
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
the
lord
saith
the
prophet
every
nation
kindred
tongue
and
people
shall
be
blessed
and
I
nephi
have
written
these
things
unto
my
people
that
perhaps
I
might
persuade
them
that
they
would
remember
the
lord
their
redeemer
wherefore
I
speak
unto
all
the
house
of
Israel
if
it
so
be
that
they
should
obtain
these
things
for
behold
I
have
workings
in
the
spirit
which
doth
weary
me
even
that
all
my
joints
are
weak
for
those
who
are
at
jerusalem
for
had
not
the
lord
been
merciful
to
show
unto
me
concerning
them
even
as
he
had
prophets
of
old
I
should
have
perished
also
and
he
surely
did
show
unto
the
prophets
of
old
all
things
concerning
them
and
also
he
did
show
unto
many
concerning
us
wherefore
it
must
needs
be
that
we
know
concerning
them
for
they
are
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass
now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
teach
my
brethren
these
things
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
read
many
things
to
them
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
that
they
might
know
concerning
the
doings
of
the
lord
in
other
lands
among
people
of
old
and
I
did
read
many
things
unto
them
which
were
written
in
the
books
of
moses
but
that
I
might
more
fully
persuade
them
to
believe
in
the
lord
their
redeemer
I
did
read
unto
them
that
which
was
written
by
the
prophet
Isaiah
for
I
did
liken
all
scriptures
unto
us
that
it
might
be
for
our
profit
and
learning
wherefore
I
spake
unto
them
saying
hear
ye
the
words
of
the
prophet
ye
who
are
a
remnant
of
the
house
of
Israel
a
branch
who
have
been
broken
off
hear
ye
the
words
of
the
prophet
which
were
written
unto
all
the
house
of
Israel
and
liken
them
unto
yourselves
that
ye
may
have
hope
as
well
as
your
brethren
from
whom
ye
have
been
broken
off
for
after
this
manner
has
the
prophet
written
hearken
and
hear
this
o
house
of
jacob
who
are
called
by
the
name
of
Israel
and
are
come
forth
out
of
the
waters
of
judah
or
out
of
the
waters
of
baptism
who
swear
by
the
name
of
the
lord
and
make
mention
of
the
god
of
Israel
yet
they
swear
not
in
truth
nor
in
righteousness
nevertheless
they
call
themselves
of
the
holy
city
but
they
do
not
stay
themselves
upon
the
god
of
Israel
who
is
the
lord
of
hosts
yea
the
lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
behold
I
have
declared
the
former
things
from
the
beginning
and
they
went
forth
out
of
my
mouth
and
I
showed
them
I
did
show
them
suddenly
and
I
did
it
because
I
knew
that
thou
art
obstinate
and
thy
neck
is
an
iron
sinew
and
thy
brow
brass
and
I
have
even
from
the
beginning
declared
to
thee
before
it
came
to
pass
I
showed
them
thee
and
I
showed
them
for
fear
lest
thou
shouldst
saymine
idol
hath
done
them
and
my
graven
image
and
my
molten
image
hath
commanded
them
thou
hast
seen
and
heard
all
this
and
will
ye
not
declare
them
and
that
I
have
showed
thee
new
things
from
this
time
even
hidden
things
and
thou
didst
not
know
them
they
are
created
now
and
not
from
the
beginning
even
before
the
day
when
thou
heardest
them
not
they
were
declared
unto
thee
lest
thou
shouldst
saybehold
I
knew
them
yea
and
thou
heardest
not
yea
thou
knewest
not
yea
from
that
time
thine
ear
was
not
opened
for
I
knew
that
thou
wouldst
deal
very
treacherously
and
wast
called
a
transgressor
from
the
womb
nevertheless
for
my
names
sake
will
I
defer
mine
anger
and
for
my
praise
will
I
refrain
from
thee
that
I
cut
thee
not
off
for
behold
I
have
refined
thee
I
have
chosen
thee
in
the
furnace
of
affliction
for
mine
own
sake
yea
for
mine
own
sake
will
I
do
this
for
I
will
not
suffer
my
name
to
be
polluted
and
I
will
not
give
my
glory
unto
another
hearken
unto
me
o
jacob
and
Israel
my
called
for
I
am
he
I
am
the
first
and
I
am
also
the
last
mine
hand
hath
also
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
and
my
right
hand
hath
spanned
the
heavens
I
call
unto
them
and
they
stand
up
together
all
ye
assemble
yourselves
and
hear
who
among
them
hath
declared
these
things
unto
them
the
lord
hath
loved
him
yea
and
he
will
fulfill
his
word
which
he
hath
declared
by
them
and
he
will
do
his
pleasure
on
babylon
and
his
arm
shall
come
upon
the
chaldeans
also
saith
the
lord
I
the
lord
yea
I
have
spoken
yea
I
have
called
him
to
declare
I
have
brought
him
and
he
shall
make
his
way
prosperous
come
ye
near
unto
me
I
have
not
spoken
in
secret
from
the
beginning
from
the
time
that
it
was
declared
have
I
spoken
and
the
lord
god
and
his
spirit
hath
sent
me
and
thus
saith
the
lord
thy
redeemer
the
holy
one
of
Israel
I
have
sent
him
the
lord
thy
god
who
teacheth
thee
to
profit
who
leadeth
thee
by
the
way
thou
shouldst
go
hath
done
it
o
that
thou
hadst
hearkened
to
my
commandmentsthen
had
thy
peace
been
as
a
river
and
thy
righteousness
as
the
waves
of
the
sea
thy
seed
also
had
been
as
the
sand
the
offspring
of
thy
bowels
like
the
gravel
thereof
his
name
should
not
have
been
cut
off
nor
destroyed
from
before
me
go
ye
forth
of
babylon
flee
ye
from
the
chaldeans
with
a
voice
of
singing
declare
ye
tell
this
utter
to
the
end
of
the
earth
say
ye
the
lord
hath
redeemed
his
servant
jacob
and
they
thirsted
not
he
led
them
through
the
deserts
he
caused
the
waters
to
flow
out
of
the
rock
for
them
he
clave
the
rock
also
and
the
waters
gushed
out
and
notwithstanding
he
hath
done
all
this
and
greater
also
there
is
no
peace
saith
the
lord
unto
the
wicked
and
again
hearken
o
ye
house
of
Israel
all
ye
that
are
broken
off
and
are
driven
out
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
pastors
of
my
people
yea
all
ye
that
are
broken
off
that
are
scattered
abroad
who
are
of
my
people
o
house
of
Israel
listen
o
isles
unto
me
and
hearken
ye
people
from
far
the
lord
hath
called
me
from
the
womb
from
the
bowels
of
my
mother
hath
he
made
mention
of
my
name
and
he
hath
made
my
mouth
like
a
sharp
sword
in
the
shadow
of
his
hand
hath
he
hid
me
and
made
me
a
polished
shaft
in
his
quiver
hath
he
hid
me
and
said
unto
me
thou
art
my
servant
o
Israel
in
whom
I
will
be
glorified
then
I
said
I
have
labored
in
vain
I
have
spent
my
strength
for
naught
and
in
vain
surely
my
judgment
is
with
the
lord
and
my
work
with
my
god
and
now
saith
the
lordthat
formed
me
from
the
womb
that
I
should
be
his
servant
to
bring
jacob
again
to
himthough
Israel
be
not
gathered
yet
shall
I
be
glorious
in
the
eyes
of
the
lord
and
my
god
shall
be
my
strength
and
he
said
It
is
a
light
thing
that
thou
shouldst
be
my
servant
to
raise
up
the
tribes
of
jacob
and
to
restore
the
preserved
of
Israel
I
will
also
give
thee
for
a
light
to
the
gentiles
that
thou
mayest
be
my
salvation
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
thus
saith
the
lord
the
redeemer
of
Israel
his
holy
one
to
him
whom
man
despiseth
to
him
whom
the
nation
abhorreth
to
servant
of
rulers
kings
shall
see
and
arise
princes
also
shall
worship
because
of
the
lord
that
is
faithful
thus
saith
the
lord
In
an
acceptable
time
have
I
heard
thee
o
isles
of
the
sea
and
in
a
day
of
salvation
have
I
helped
thee
and
I
will
preserve
thee
and
give
thee
my
servant
for
a
covenant
of
the
people
to
establish
the
earth
to
cause
to
inherit
the
desolate
heritages
that
thou
mayest
say
to
the
prisoners
go
forth
to
them
that
sit
in
darkness
show
yourselves
they
shall
feed
in
the
ways
and
their
pastures
shall
be
in
all
high
places
they
shall
not
hunger
nor
thirst
neither
shall
the
heat
nor
the
sun
smite
them
for
he
that
hath
mercy
on
them
shall
lead
them
even
by
the
springs
of
water
shall
he
guide
them
and
I
will
make
all
my
mountains
a
way
and
my
highways
shall
be
exalted
and
then
o
house
of
Israel
behold
these
shall
come
from
far
and
lo
these
from
the
north
and
from
the
west
and
these
from
the
land
of
sinim
sing
o
heavens
and
be
joyful
o
earth
for
the
feet
of
those
who
are
in
the
east
shall
be
established
and
break
forth
into
singing
o
mountains
for
they
shall
be
smitten
no
more
for
the
lord
hath
comforted
his
people
and
will
have
mercy
upon
his
afflicted
but
behold
zion
hath
said
the
lord
hath
forsaken
me
and
my
lord
hath
forgotten
mebut
he
will
show
that
he
hath
not
for
can
a
woman
forget
her
sucking
child
that
she
should
not
have
compassion
on
the
son
of
her
womb
yea
they
may
forget
yet
will
I
not
forget
thee
o
house
of
Israel
behold
I
have
graven
thee
upon
the
palms
of
my
hands
thy
walls
are
continually
before
me
thy
children
shall
make
haste
against
thy
destroyers
and
they
that
made
thee
waste
shall
go
forth
of
thee
lift
up
thine
eyes
round
about
and
behold
all
these
gather
themselves
together
and
they
shall
come
to
thee
and
as
I
live
saith
the
lord
thou
shalt
surely
clothe
thee
with
them
all
as
with
an
ornament
and
bind
them
on
even
as
a
bride
for
thy
waste
and
thy
desolate
places
and
the
land
of
thy
destruction
shall
even
now
be
too
narrow
by
reason
of
the
inhabitants
and
they
that
swallowed
thee
up
shall
be
far
away
the
children
whom
thou
shalt
have
after
thou
hast
lost
the
first
shall
again
in
thine
ears
say
the
place
is
too
strait
for
me
give
place
to
me
that
I
may
dwell
then
shalt
thou
say
in
thine
heart
who
hath
begotten
me
these
seeing
I
have
lost
my
children
and
am
desolate
a
captive
and
removing
to
and
fro
and
who
hath
brought
up
these
behold
I
was
left
alone
these
where
have
they
been
thus
saith
the
lord
god
behold
I
will
lift
up
mine
hand
to
the
gentiles
and
set
up
my
standard
to
the
people
and
they
shall
bring
thy
sons
in
their
arms
and
thy
daughters
shall
be
carried
upon
their
shoulders
and
kings
shall
be
thy
nursing
fathers
and
their
queens
thy
nursing
mothers
they
shall
bow
down
to
thee
with
their
face
towards
the
earth
and
lick
up
the
dust
of
thy
feet
and
thou
shalt
know
that
I
am
the
lord
for
they
shall
not
be
ashamed
that
wait
for
me
for
shall
the
prey
be
taken
from
the
mighty
or
the
lawful
captives
delivered
but
thus
saith
the
lord
even
the
captives
of
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
away
and
the
prey
of
the
terrible
shall
be
delivered
for
I
will
contend
with
him
that
contendeth
with
thee
and
I
will
save
thy
children
and
I
will
feed
them
that
oppress
thee
with
their
own
flesh
they
shall
be
drunken
with
their
own
blood
as
with
sweet
wine
and
all
flesh
shall
know
that
I
the
lord
am
thy
savior
and
thy
redeemer
the
mighty
one
of
jacob
and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
nephi
had
read
these
things
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
my
brethren
came
unto
me
and
said
unto
me
what
meaneth
these
things
which
ye
have
read
behold
are
they
to
be
understood
according
to
things
which
are
spiritual
which
shall
come
to
pass
according
to
the
spirit
and
not
the
flesh
and
I
nephi
said
unto
them
behold
they
were
manifest
unto
the
prophet
by
the
voice
of
the
spirit
for
by
the
spirit
are
all
things
made
known
unto
the
prophets
which
shall
come
upon
the
children
of
men
according
to
the
flesh
wherefore
the
things
of
which
I
have
read
are
things
pertaining
to
things
both
temporal
and
spiritual
for
it
appears
that
the
house
of
Israel
sooner
or
later
will
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
also
among
all
nations
and
behold
there
are
many
who
are
already
lost
from
the
knowledge
of
those
who
are
at
jerusalem
yea
the
more
part
of
all
the
tribes
have
been
led
away
and
they
are
scattered
to
and
fro
upon
the
isles
of
the
sea
and
whither
they
are
none
of
us
knoweth
save
that
we
know
that
they
have
been
led
away
and
since
they
have
been
led
away
these
things
have
been
prophesied
concerning
them
and
also
concerning
all
those
who
shall
hereafter
be
scattered
and
be
confounded
because
of
the
holy
one
of
Israel
for
against
him
will
they
harden
their
hearts
wherefore
they
shall
be
scattered
among
all
nations
and
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
nevertheless
after
they
shall
be
nursed
by
the
gentiles
and
the
lord
has
lifted
up
his
hand
upon
the
gentiles
and
set
them
up
for
a
standard
and
their
children
have
been
carried
in
their
arms
and
their
daughters
have
been
carried
upon
their
shoulders
behold
these
things
of
which
are
spoken
are
temporal
for
thus
are
the
covenants
of
the
lord
with
our
fathers
and
it
meaneth
us
in
the
days
to
come
and
also
all
our
brethren
who
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
and
it
meaneth
that
the
time
cometh
that
after
all
the
house
of
Israel
have
been
scattered
and
confounded
that
the
lord
god
will
raise
up
a
mighty
nation
among
the
gentiles
yea
even
upon
the
face
of
this
land
and
by
them
shall
our
seed
be
scattered
and
after
our
seed
is
scattered
the
lord
god
will
proceed
to
do
a
marvelous
work
among
the
gentiles
which
shall
be
of
great
worth
unto
our
seed
wherefore
it
is
likened
unto
their
being
nourished
by
the
gentiles
and
being
carried
in
their
arms
and
upon
their
shoulders
and
it
shall
also
be
of
worth
unto
the
gentiles
and
not
only
unto
the
gentiles
but
unto
all
the
house
of
Israel
unto
the
making
known
of
the
covenants
of
the
father
of
heaven
unto
abraham
saying
In
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed
and
I
would
my
brethren
that
ye
should
know
that
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
cannot
be
blessed
unless
he
shall
make
bare
his
arm
in
the
eyes
of
the
nations
wherefore
the
lord
god
will
proceed
to
make
bare
his
arm
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
nations
in
bringing
about
his
covenants
and
his
gospel
unto
those
who
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
wherefore
he
will
bring
them
again
out
of
captivity
and
they
shall
be
gathered
together
to
the
lands
of
their
inheritance
and
they
shall
be
brought
out
of
obscurity
and
out
of
darkness
and
they
shall
know
that
the
lord
is
their
savior
and
their
redeemer
the
mighty
one
of
Israel
and
the
blood
of
that
great
and
abominable
church
which
is
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
shall
turn
upon
their
own
heads
for
they
shall
war
among
themselves
and
the
sword
of
their
own
hands
shall
fall
upon
their
own
heads
and
they
shall
be
drunken
with
their
own
blood
and
every
nation
which
shall
war
against
thee
o
house
of
Israel
shall
be
turned
one
against
another
and
they
shall
fall
into
the
pit
which
they
digged
to
ensnare
the
people
of
the
lord
and
all
that
fight
against
zion
shall
be
destroyed
and
that
great
whore
who
hath
perverted
the
right
ways
of
the
lord
yea
that
great
and
abominable
church
shall
tumble
to
the
dust
and
great
shall
be
the
fall
of
it
for
behold
saith
the
prophet
the
time
cometh
speedily
that
satan
shall
have
no
more
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
for
the
day
soon
cometh
that
all
the
proud
and
they
who
do
wickedly
shall
be
as
stubble
and
the
day
cometh
that
they
must
be
burned
for
the
time
soon
cometh
that
the
fulness
of
the
wrath
of
god
shall
be
poured
out
upon
all
the
children
of
men
for
he
will
not
suffer
that
the
wicked
shall
destroy
the
righteous
wherefore
he
will
preserve
the
righteous
by
his
power
even
if
it
so
be
that
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
must
come
and
the
righteous
be
preserved
even
unto
the
destruction
of
their
enemies
by
fire
wherefore
the
righteous
need
not
fear
for
thus
saith
the
prophet
they
shall
be
saved
even
if
it
so
be
as
by
fire
behold
my
brethren
I
say
unto
you
that
these
things
must
shortly
come
yea
even
blood
and
fire
and
vapor
of
smoke
must
come
and
it
must
needs
be
upon
the
face
of
this
earth
and
it
cometh
unto
men
according
to
the
flesh
if
it
so
be
that
they
will
harden
their
hearts
against
the
holy
one
of
Israel
for
behold
the
righteous
shall
not
perish
for
the
time
surely
must
come
that
all
they
who
fight
against
zion
shall
be
cut
off
and
the
lord
will
surely
prepare
a
way
for
his
people
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
words
of
moses
which
he
spake
saying
a
prophet
shall
the
lord
your
god
raise
up
unto
you
like
unto
me
him
shall
ye
hear
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
you
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
all
those
who
will
not
hear
that
prophet
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
the
people
and
now
I
nephi
declare
unto
you
that
this
prophet
of
whom
moses
spake
was
the
holy
one
of
Israel
wherefore
he
shall
execute
judgment
in
righteousness
and
the
righteous
need
not
fear
for
they
are
those
who
shall
not
be
confounded
but
it
is
the
kingdom
of
the
devil
which
shall
be
built
up
among
the
children
of
men
which
kingdom
is
established
among
them
which
are
in
the
flesh
for
the
time
speedily
shall
come
that
all
churches
which
are
built
up
to
get
gain
and
all
those
who
are
built
up
to
get
power
over
the
flesh
and
those
who
are
built
up
to
become
popular
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
those
who
seek
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
and
the
things
of
the
world
and
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
yea
in
fine
all
those
who
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
the
devil
are
they
who
need
fear
and
tremble
and
quake
they
are
those
who
must
be
brought
low
in
the
dust
they
are
those
who
must
be
consumed
as
stubble
and
this
is
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophet
and
the
time
cometh
speedily
that
the
righteous
must
be
led
up
as
calves
of
the
stall
and
the
holy
one
of
Israel
must
reign
in
dominion
and
might
and
power
and
great
glory
and
he
gathereth
his
children
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
and
he
numbereth
his
sheep
and
they
know
him
and
there
shall
be
one
fold
and
one
shepherd
and
he
shall
feed
his
sheep
and
in
him
they
shall
find
pasture
and
because
of
the
righteousness
of
his
people
satan
has
no
power
wherefore
he
cannot
be
loosed
for
the
space
of
many
years
for
he
hath
no
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
people
for
they
dwell
in
righteousness
and
the
holy
one
of
Israel
reigneth
and
now
behold
I
nephi
say
unto
you
that
all
these
things
must
come
according
to
the
flesh
but
behold
all
nations
kindreds
tongues
and
people
shall
dwell
safely
in
the
holy
one
of
Israel
if
it
so
be
that
they
will
repent
and
now
I
nephi
make
an
end
for
I
durst
not
speak
further
as
yet
concerning
these
things
wherefore
my
brethren
I
would
that
ye
should
consider
that
the
things
which
have
been
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass
are
true
and
they
testify
that
a
man
must
be
obedient
to
the
commandments
of
god
wherefore
ye
need
not
suppose
that
I
and
my
father
are
the
only
ones
that
have
testified
and
also
taught
them
wherefore
if
ye
shall
be
obedient
to
the
commandments
and
endure
to
the
end
ye
shall
be
saved
at
the
last
day
and
thus
it
is
amen
