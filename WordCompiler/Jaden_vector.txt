to
ask
me
what

would
say
what
a

talk
to
you
about
spacetime
over
facetime
they
distract
you
with
us
so
you
dont
pay
attention
to
the

In

whenever
you
disagree
with
somebody
just
remember
the
dress
and
accept
that

are
seeIng
two
different
things
all
of
your
Idols
are
going

you
start
doing
math

Is
the
definition
of
light
