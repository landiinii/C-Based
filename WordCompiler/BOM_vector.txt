I
nephi
having
been
born
of
goodly
parents
therefore
I
wastaught
somewhat
in
all
the
learning
of
my
father
and
having
seenmany
afflictions
in
the
course
of
my
days
nevertheless
havingbeen
highly
favored
of
the
lord
in
all
my
days
yea
having
had
agreat
knowledge
of
the
goodness
and
the
mysteries
of
godtherefore
I
make
a
record
of
my
proceedings
in
my
days
nephi


yea
I
make
a
record
in
the
language
of
my
father
whichconsists
of
the
learning
of
the
jews
and
the
language
of
theegyptians
nephi


and
I
know
that
the
record
which
I
make
is
true
and
I
make
itwith
mine
own
hand
and
I
make
it
according
to
my
knowledge
nephi


for
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
first
year
ofthe
reign
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah
my
father
lehi
havingdwelt
at
jerusalem
in
all
his
days
and
in
that
same
year
therecame
many
prophets
prophesying
unto
the
people
that
they
mustrepent
or
the
great
city
jerusalem
must
be
destroyed
nephi


wherefore
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
lehi
as
he
wentforth
prayed
unto
the
lord
yea
even
with
all
his
heart
inbehalf
of
his
people
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
prayed
unto
the
lord
there
came
apillar
of
fire
and
dwelt
upon
a
rock
before
him
and
he
saw
andheard
much
and
because
of
the
things
which
he
saw
and
heard
hedid
quake
and
tremble
exceedingly
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
returned
to
his
own
house
atjerusalem
and
he
cast
himself
upon
his
bed
being
overcome
withthe
spirit
and
the
things
which
he
had
seen
nephi


and
being
thus
overcome
with
the
spirit
he
was
carried
awayin
a
vision
even
that
he
saw
the
heavens
open
and
he
thought
hesaw
god
sitting
upon
his
throne
surrounded
with
numberlessconcourses
of
angels
in
the
attitude
of
singing
and
praisingtheir
god
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
saw
one
descending
out
of
themidst
of
heaven
and
he
beheld
that
his
luster
was
above
that
ofthe
sun
at
noonday
nephi


and
he
also
saw
twelve
others
following
him
and
theirbrightness
did
exceed
that
of
the
stars
in
the
firmament
nephi


and
they
came
down
and
went
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
earthand
the
first
came
and
stood
before
my
father
and
gave
unto
hima
book
and
bade
him
that
he
should
read
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
he
read
he
was
filled
with
thespirit
of
the
lord
nephi


and
he
read
saying
wo
wo
unto
jerusalem
for
I
have
seenthine
abominations

yea
and
many
things
did
my
father
readconcerning
jerusalemthat
it
should
be
destroyed
and
theinhabitants
thereof
many
should
perish
by
the
sword
and
manyshould
be
carried
away
captive
into
babylon
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
read
and
seenmany
great
and
marvelous
things
he
did
exclaim
many
things
untothe
lord
such
as
great
and
marvelous
are
thy
works
o
lord
godalmighty

thy
throne
is
high
in
the
heavens
and
thy
power
andgoodness
and
mercy
are
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earthand
because
thou
art
merciful
thou
wilt
not
suffer
those
whocome
unto
thee
that
they
shall
perish
nephi


and
after
this
manner
was
the
language
of
my
father
in
thepraising
of
his
god
for
his
soul
did
rejoice
and
his
wholeheart
was
filled
because
of
the
things
which
he
had
seen
yeawhich
the
lord
had
shown
unto
him
nephi


and
now
I
nephi
do
not
make
a
full
account
of
the
thingswhich
my
father
hath
written
for
he
hath
written
many
thingswhich
he
saw
in
visions
and
in
dreams
and
he
also
hath
writtenmany
things
which
he
prophesied
and
spake
unto
his
children
ofwhich
I
shall
not
make
a
full
account
nephi


but
I
shall
make
an
account
of
my
proceedings
in
my
days
behold
I
make
an
abridgment
of
the
record
of
my
father
uponplates
which
I
have
made
with
mine
own
hands
wherefore
after
Ihave
abridged
the
record
of
my
father
then
will
I
make
an
accountof
mine
own
life
nephi


therefore
I
would
that
ye
should
know
that
after
the
lordhad
shown
so
many
marvelous
things
unto
my
father
lehi
yeaconcerning
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
behold
he
went
forthamong
the
people
and
began
to
prophesy
and
to
declare
unto
themconcerning
the
things
which
he
had
both
seen
and
heard
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
jews
did
mock
him
because
of
thethings
which
he
testified
of
them
for
he
truly
testified
oftheir
wickedness
and
their
abominations
and
he
testified
thatthe
things
which
he
saw
and
heard
and
also
the
things
which
heread
in
the
book
manifested
plainly
of
the
coming
of
themessiah
and
also
the
redemption
of
the
world
nephi


and
when
the
jews
heard
these
things
they
were
angry
withhim
yea
even
as
with
the
prophets
of
old
whom
they
had
castout
and
stoned
and
slain
and
they
also
sought
his
life
thatthey
might
take
it
away

but
behold
I
nephi
will
show
untoyou
that
the
tender
mercies
of
the
lord
are
over
all
those
whomhe
hath
chosen
because
of
their
faith
to
make
them
mighty
evenunto
the
power
of
deliverance
nephi
chapter

nephi


for
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
myfather
yea
even
in
a
dream
and
said
unto
him
blessed
art
thoulehi
because
of
the
things
which
thou
hast
done
and
becausethou
hast
been
faithful
and
declared
unto
this
people
the
thingswhich
I
commanded
thee
behold
they
seek
to
take
away
thy
life
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
commanded
my
father
even
ina
dream
that
he
should
take
his
family
and
depart
into
thewilderness
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
obedient
unto
the
word
of
thelord
wherefore
he
did
as
the
lord
commanded
him
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
departed
into
the
wilderness

andhe
left
his
house
and
the
land
of
his
inheritance
and
his
goldand
his
silver
and
his
precious
things
and
took
nothing
withhim
save
it
were
his
family
and
provisions
and
tents
anddeparted
into
the
wilderness
nephi


and
he
came
down
by
the
borders
near
the
shore
of
the
red
seaand
he
traveled
in
the
wilderness
in
the
borders
which
are
nearerthe
red
sea
and
he
did
travel
in
the
wilderness
with
his
familywhich
consisted
of
my
mother
sariah
and
my
elder
brothers
whowere
laman
lemuel
and
sam
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
traveled
three
days
inthe
wilderness
he
pitched
his
tent
in
a
valley
by
the
side
of
ariver
of
water
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
built
an
altar
of
stones
and
madean
offering
unto
the
lord
and
gave
thanks
unto
the
lord
our
god
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
called
the
name
of
the
riverlaman
and
it
emptied
into
the
red
sea
and
the
valley
was
in
theborders
near
the
mouth
thereof
nephi


and
when
my
father
saw
that
the
waters
of
the
river
emptiedinto
the
fountain
of
the
red
sea
he
spake
unto
laman
saying
othat
thou
mightest
be
like
unto
this
river
continually
runninginto
the
fountain
of
all
righteousness
nephi


and
he
also
spake
unto
lemuel
o
that
thou
mightest
be
likeunto
this
valley
firm
and
steadfast
and
immovable
in
keepingthe
commandments
of
the
lord
nephi


now
this
he
spake
because
of
the
stiffneckedness
of
laman
andlemuel
for
behold
they
did
murmur
in
many
things
against
theirfather
because
he
was
a
visionary
man
and
had
led
them
out
ofthe
land
of
jerusalem
to
leave
the
land
of
their
inheritanceand
their
gold
and
their
silver
and
their
precious
things
toperish
in
the
wilderness

and
this
they
said
he
had
done
becauseof
the
foolish
imaginations
of
his
heart
nephi


and
thus
laman
and
lemuel
being
the
eldest
did
murmuragainst
their
father

and
they
did
murmur
because
they
knew
notthe
dealings
of
that
god
who
had
created
them
nephi


neither
did
they
believe
that
jerusalem
that
great
citycould
be
destroyed
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophets

andthey
were
like
unto
the
jews
who
were
at
jerusalem
who
sought
totake
away
the
life
of
my
father
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
did
speak
unto
them
in
thevalley
of
lemuel
with
power
being
filled
with
the
spirit
untiltheir
frames
did
shake
before
him

and
he
did
confound
themthat
they
durst
not
utter
against
him
wherefore
they
did
as
hecommanded
them
nephi


and
my
father
dwelt
in
a
tent
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
being
exceedingly
youngnevertheless
being
large
in
stature
and
also
having
greatdesires
to
know
of
the
mysteries
of
god
wherefore
I
did
cryunto
the
lord
and
behold
he
did
visit
me
and
did
soften
myheart
that
I
did
believe
all
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
bymy
father
wherefore
I
did
not
rebel
against
him
like
unto
mybrothers
nephi


and
I
spake
unto
sam
making
known
unto
him
the
things
whichthe
lord
had
manifested
unto
me
by
his
holy
spirit

and
it
cameto
pass
that
he
believed
in
my
words
nephi


but
behold
laman
and
lemuel
would
not
hearken
unto
mywords
and
being
grieved
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
heartsI
cried
unto
the
lord
for
them
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
me
sayingblessed
art
thou
nephi
because
of
thy
faith
for
thou
hastsought
me
diligently
with
lowliness
of
heart
nephi


and
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
ye
shallprosper
and
shall
be
led
to
a
land
of
promise
yea
even
a
landwhich
I
have
prepared
for
you
yea
a
land
which
is
choice
aboveall
other
lands
nephi


and
inasmuch
as
thy
brethren
shall
rebel
against
thee
theyshall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
nephi


and
inasmuch
as
thou
shalt
keep
my
commandments
thou
shaltbe
made
a
ruler
and
a
teacher
over
thy
brethren
nephi


for
behold
in
that
day
that
they
shall
rebel
against
me
Iwill
curse
them
even
with
a
sore
curse
and
they
shall
have
nopower
over
thy
seed
except
they
shall
rebel
against
me
also
nephi


and
if
it
so
be
that
they
rebel
against
me
they
shall
be
ascourge
unto
thy
seed
to
stir
them
up
in
the

chapter

nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
returned
from
speaking
withthe
lord
to
the
tent
of
my
father
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
Ihave
dreamed
a
dream
in
the
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
methat
thou
and
thy
brethren
shall
return
to
jerusalem
nephi


for
behold
laban
hath
the
record
of
the
jews
and
also
agenealogy
of
my
forefathers
and
they
are
engraven
upon
plates
ofbrass
nephi


wherefore
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
that
thou
and
thybrothers
should
go
unto
the
house
of
laban
and
seek
the
recordsand
bring
them
down
hither
into
the
wilderness
nephi


and
now
behold
thy
brothers
murmur
saying
it
is
a
hard
thingwhich
I
have
required
of
them
but
behold
I
have
not
required
itof
them
but
it
is
a
commandment
of
the
lord
nephi


therefore
go
my
son
and
thou
shalt
be
favored
of
the
lordbecause
thou
hast
not
murmured
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
said
unto
my
father
I
willgo
and
do
the
things
which
the
lord
hath
commanded
for
I
knowthat
the
lord
giveth
no
commandments
unto
the
children
of
mensave
he
shall
prepare
a
way
for
them
that
they
may
accomplish
thething
which
he
commandeth
them
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
heard
these
wordshe
was
exceedingly
glad
for
he
knew
that
I
had
been
blessed
ofthe
lord
nephi


and
I
nephi
and
my
brethren
took
our
journey
in
thewilderness
with
our
tents
to
go
up
to
the
land
of
jerusalem
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
we
had
gone
up
to
the
land
ofjerusalem
I
and
my
brethren
did
consult
one
with
another
nephi


and
we
cast
lotswho
of
us
should
go
in
unto
the
house
oflaban

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lot
fell
upon
laman
andlaman
went
in
unto
the
house
of
laban
and
he
talked
with
him
ashe
sat
in
his
house
nephi


and
he
desired
of
laban
the
records
which
were
engraven
uponthe
plates
of
brass
which
contained
the
genealogy
of
my
father
nephi


and
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
laban
was
angry
and
thrusthim
out
from
his
presence
and
he
would
not
that
he
should
havethe
records

wherefore
he
said
unto
him
behold
thou
art
arobber
and
I
will
slay
thee
nephi


but
laman
fled
out
of
his
presence
and
told
the
things
whichlaban
had
done
unto
us

and
we
began
to
be
exceedinglysorrowful
and
my
brethren
were
about
to
return
unto
my
father
inthe
wilderness
nephi


but
behold
I
said
unto
them
that
as
the
lord
liveth
and
aswe
live
we
will
not
go
down
unto
our
father
in
the
wildernessuntil
we
have
accomplished
the
thing
which
the
lord
hathcommanded
us
nephi


wherefore
let
us
be
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
ofthe
lord
therefore
let
us
go
down
to
the
land
of
our
fathersinheritance
for
behold
he
left
gold
and
silver
and
all
mannerof
riches

and
all
this
he
hath
done
because
of
the
commandmentsof
the
lord
nephi


for
he
knew
that
jerusalem
must
be
destroyed
because
of
thewickedness
of
the
people
nephi


for
behold
they
have
rejected
the
words
of
the
prophets
wherefore
if
my
father
should
dwell
in
the
land
after
he
hathbeen
commanded
to
flee
out
of
the
land
behold
he
would
alsoperish

wherefore
it
must
needs
be
that
he
flee
out
of
theland
nephi


and
behold
it
is
wisdom
in
god
that
we
should
obtain
theserecords
that
we
may
preserve
unto
our
children
the
language
ofour
fathers
nephi


and
also
that
we
may
preserve
unto
them
the
words
which
havebeen
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
the
holy
prophets
which
havebeen
delivered
unto
them
by
the
spirit
and
power
of
god
sincethe
world
began
even
down
unto
this
present
time
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
this
manner
of
language
did
Ipersuade
my
brethren
that
they
might
be
faithful
in
keeping
thecommandments
of
god
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
down
to
the
land
of
ourinheritance
and
we
did
gather
together
our
gold
and
our
silverand
our
precious
things
nephi


and
after
we
had
gathered
these
things
together
we
went
upagain
unto
the
house
of
laban
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
in
unto
laban
and
desiredhim
that
he
would
give
unto
us
the
records
which
were
engravenupon
the
plates
of
brass
for
which
we
would
give
unto
him
ourgold
and
our
silver
and
all
our
precious
things
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
laban
saw
our
property
andthat
it
was
exceedingly
great
he
did
lust
after
it
insomuchthat
he
thrust
us
out
and
sent
his
servants
to
slay
us
that
hemight
obtain
our
property
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
flee
before
the
servants
oflaban
and
we
were
obliged
to
leave
behind
our
property
and
itfell
into
the
hands
of
laban
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
fled
into
the
wilderness
and
theservants
of
laban
did
not
overtake
us
and
we
hid
ourselves
inthe
cavity
of
a
rock
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
laman
was
angry
with
me
and
alsowith
my
father
and
also
was
lemuel
for
he
hearkened
unto
thewords
of
laman

wherefore
laman
and
lemuel
did
speak
many
hardwords
unto
us
their

they
did
smite
us
evenwith
a
rod

and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
smote
us
with
a
rod
behold
anangel
of
the
lord
came
and
stood
before
them
and
he
spake
untothem
saying
why
do
ye
smite
your
younger
brother
with
a

know
ye
not
that
the
lord
hath
chosen
him
to
be

this
because

iniquities

behold
ye
shall
go

nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
spake
unto
my
brethren
saying
letus
go
up
again
unto
jerusalem
and
let
us
be
faithful
in
keepingthe
commandments
of
the
lord
for
behold
he
is
mightier
than
allthe
earth
then
why
not
mightier
than
laban
and
his
fifty
yeaor
even
than
his
tens
of
thousands
nephi


therefore
let
us
go
up
let
us
be
strong
like
unto
moses
forhe
truly
spake
unto
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
and
they
dividedhither
and
thither
and
our
fathers
came
through
out
ofcaptivity
on
dry
ground
and
the
armies
of
pharaoh
did
followand
were
drowned
in
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
nephi


now
behold
ye
know
that
this
is
true
and
ye
also
know
that
anangel
hath
spoken
unto
you
wherefore
can
ye
doubt

let
us
goup
the
lord
is
able
to
deliver
us
even
as
our
fathers
and
todestroy
laban
even
as
the
egyptians
nephi


now
when
I
had
spoken
these
words
they
were
yet
wroth
anddid
still
continue
to
murmur
nevertheless
they
did
follow
me
upuntil
we
came
without
the
walls
of
jerusalem
nephi


and
it
was
by
night
and
I
caused
that
they
should
hidethemselves
without
the
walls

and
after
they
had
hid
themselvesI
nephi
crept
into
the
city
and
went
forth
towards
the
house
oflaban
nephi


and
I
was
led
by
the
spirit
not
knowing
beforehand
the
thingswhich
I
should
do
nephi


nevertheless
I
went
forth
and
as
I
came
near
unto
the
houseof
laban
I
beheld
a
man
and
he
had
fallen
to
the
earth
beforeme
for
he
was
drunken
with
wine
nephi


and
when
I
came
to
him
I
found
that
it
was
laban
nephi


and
I
beheld
his
sword
and
I
drew
it
forth
from
the
sheaththereof
and
the
hilt
thereof
was
of
pure
gold
and
theworkmanship
thereof
was
exceedingly
fine
and
I
saw
that
theblade
thereof
was
of
the
most
precious
steel
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
was
constrained
by
the
spirit
thatI
should
kill
laban
but
I
said
in
my
heart
never
at
any
timehave
I
shed
the
blood
of
man

and
I
shrunk
and
would
that
Imight
not
slay
him
nephi


and
the
spirit
said
unto
me
again
behold
the
lord
hathdelivered
him
into
thy
hands

yea
and
I
also
knew
that
he
hadsought
to
take
away
mine
own
life
yea
and
he
would
not
hearkenunto
the
commandments
of
the
lord
and
he
also
had
taken
away
ourproperty
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
spirit
said
unto
me
again
slayhim
for
the
lord
hath
delivered
him
into
thy
hands
nephi


behold
the
lord
slayeth
the
wicked
to
bring
forth
hisrighteous
purposes

It
is
better
that
one
man
should
perish
thanthat
a
nation
should
dwindle
and
perish
in
unbelief
nephi


and
now
when
I
nephi
had
heard
these
words
I
rememberedthe
words
of
the
lord
which
he
spake
unto
me
in
the
wildernesssaying
that
Inasmuch
as
thy
seed
shall
keep
my
commandmentsthey
shall
prosper
in
the
land
of
promise
nephi


yea
and
I
also
thought
that
they
could
not
keep
thecommandments
of
the
lord
according
to
the
law
of
moses
save
theyshould
have
the
law
nephi


and
I
also
knew
that
the
law
was
engraven
upon
the
plates
ofbrass
nephi


and
again
I
knew
that
the
lord
had
delivered
laban
into
myhands
for
this
causethat
I
might
obtain
the
records
accordingto
his
commandments
nephi


therefore
I
did
obey
the
voice
of
the
spirit
and
took
labanby
the
hair
of
the
head
and
I
smote
off
his
head
with
his
ownsword
nephi


and
after
I
had
smitten
off
his
head
with
his
own
sword
Itook
the
garments
of
laban
and
put
them
upon
mine
own
body
yeaeven
every
whit
and
I
did
gird
on
his
armor
about
my
loins
nephi


and
after
I
had
done
this
I
went
forth
unto
the
treasury
oflaban

and
as
I
went
forth
towards
the
treasury
of
labanbehold
I
saw
the
servant
of
laban
who
had
the
keys
of
thetreasury

and
I
commanded
him
in
the
voice
of
laban
that
heshould
go
with
me
into
the
treasury
nephi


and
he
supposed
me
to
be
his
master
laban
for
he
beheld
thegarments
and
also
the
sword
girded
about
my
loins
nephi


and
he
spake
unto
me
concerning
the
elders
of
the
jews
heknowing
that
his
master
laban
had
been
out
by
night
among
them
nephi


and
I
spake
unto
him
as
if
it
had
been
laban
nephi


and
I
also
spake
unto
him
that
I
should
carry
the
engravingswhich
were
upon
the
plates
of
brass
to
my
elder
brethren
whowere
without
the
walls
nephi


and
I
also
bade
him
that
he
should
follow
me
nephi


and
he
supposing
that
I
spake
of
the
brethren
of
the
churchand
that
I
was
truly
that
laban
whom
I
had
slain
wherefore
hedid
follow
me
nephi


and
he
spake
unto
me
many
times
concerning
the
elders
of
thejews
as
I
went
forth
unto
my
brethren
who
were
without
thewalls
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
laman
saw
me
he
was
exceedinglyfrightened
and
also
lemuel
and
sam

and
they
fled
from
beforemy
presence
for
they
supposed
it
was
laban
and
that
he
hadslain
me
and
had
sought
to
take
away
their
lives
also
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
called
after
them
and
they
didhear
me
wherefore
they
did
cease
to
flee
from
my
presence
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
servant
of
laban
beheld
mybrethren
he
began
to
tremble
and
was
about
to
flee
from
beforeme
and
return
to
the
city
of
jerusalem
nephi


and
now
I
nephi
being
a
man
large
in
stature
and
alsohaving
received
much
strength
of
the
lord
therefore
I
did
seizeupon
the
servant
of
laban
and
held
him
that
he
should
not
flee
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
spake
with
him
that
if
he
wouldhearken
unto
my
words
as
the
lord
liveth
and
as
I
live
even
sothat
if
he
would
hearken
unto
our
words
we
would
spare
his
life
nephi


and
I
spake
unto
him
even
with
an
oath
that
he
need
notfear
that
he
should
be
a
free
man
like
unto
us
if
he
would
godown
in
the
wilderness
with
us
nephi


and
I
also
spake
unto
him
saying
surely
the
lord
hathcommanded
us
to
do
this
thing
and
shall
we
not
be
diligent
inkeeping
the
commandments
of
the
lord

therefore
if
thou
wilt
godown
into
the
wilderness
to
my
father
thou
shalt
have
place
withus
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
zoram
did
take
courage
at
the
wordswhich
I
spake

now
zoram
was
the
name
of
the
servant
and
hepromised
that
he
would
go
down
into
the
wilderness
unto
ourfather

yea
and
he
also
made
an
oath
unto
us
that
he
wouldtarry
with
us
from
that
time
forth
nephi


now
we
were
desirous
that
he
should
tarry
with
us
for
thiscause
that
the
jews
might
not
know
concerning
our
flight
intothe
wilderness
lest
they
should
pursue
us
and
destroy
us
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
zoram
had
made
an
oath
unto
usour
fears
did
cease
concerning
him
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
took
the
plates
of
brass
and
theservant
of
laban
and
departed
into
the
wilderness
and
journeyedunto
the
tent
of
our
father
nephi
chapter

nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
come
down
into
thewilderness
unto
our
father
behold
he
was
filled
with
joy
andalso
my
mother
sariah
was
exceedingly
glad
for
she
truly
hadmourned
because
of
us
nephi


for
she
had
supposed
that
we
had
perished
in
the
wildernessand
she
also
had
complained
against
my
father
telling
him
thathe
was
a
visionary
man
saying
behold
thou
hast
led
us
forthfrom
the
land
of
our
inheritance
and
my
sons
are
no
more
and
weperish
in
the
wilderness
nephi


and
after
this
manner
of
language
had
my
mother
complainedagainst
my
father
nephi


and
it
had
come
to
pass
that
my
father
spake
unto
her
sayingI
know
that
I
am
a
visionary
man
for
if
I
had
not
seen
thethings
of
god
in
a
vision
I
should
not
have
known
the
goodness
ofgod
but
had
tarried
at
jerusalem
and
had
perished
with
mybrethren
nephi


but
behold
I
have
obtained
a
land
of
promise
in
the
whichthings
I
do
rejoice
yea
and
I
know
that
the
lord
will
delivermy
sons
out
of
the
hands
of
laban
and
bring
them
down
again
untous
in
the
wilderness
nephi


and
after
this
manner
of
language
did
my
father
lehi
comfortmy
mother
sariah
concerning
us
while
we
journeyed
in
thewilderness
up
to
the
land
of
jerusalem
to
obtain
the
record
ofthe
jews
nephi


and
when
we
had
returned
to
the
tent
of
my
father
beholdtheir
joy
was
full
and
my
mother
was
comforted
nephi


and
she
spake
saying
now
I
know
of
a
surety
that
the
lordhath
commanded
my
husband
to
flee
into
the
wilderness
yea
and
Ialso
know
of
a
surety
that
the
lord
hath
protected
my
sons
anddelivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
laban
and
given
them
powerwhereby
they
could
accomplish
the
thing
which
the
lord
hathcommanded
them

and
after
this
manner
of
language
did
she
speak
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
rejoice
exceedingly
and
didoffer
sacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
unto
the
lord
and
they
gavethanks
unto
the
god
of
Israel
nephi


and
after
they
had
given
thanks
unto
the
god
of
Israel
myfather
lehi
took
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
theplates
of
brass
and
he
did
search
them
from
the
beginning
nephi


and
he
beheld
that
they
did
contain
the
five
books
of
moseswhich
gave
an
account
of
the
creation
of
the
world
and
also
ofadam
and
eve
who
were
our
first
parents
nephi


and
also
a
record
of
the
jews
from
the
beginning
even
downto
the
commencement
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
king
of
judah
nephi


and
also
the
prophecies
of
the
holy
prophets
from
thebeginning
even
down
to
the
commencement
of
the
reign
ofzedekiah
and
also
many
prophecies
which
have
been
spoken
by
themouth
of
jeremiah
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
lehi
also
found
upon
theplates
of
brass
a
genealogy
of
his
fathers
wherefore
he
knewthat
he
was
a
descendant
of
joseph
yea
even
that
joseph
who
wasthe
son
of
jacob
who
was
sold
into
egypt
and
who
was
preservedby
the
hand
of
the
lord
that
he
might
preserve
his
fatherjacob
and
all
his
household
from
perishing
with
famine
nephi


and
they
were
also
led
out
of
captivity
and
out
of
the
landof
egypt
by
that
same
god
who
had
preserved
them
nephi


and
thus
my
father
lehi
did
discover
the
genealogy
of
hisfathers

and
laban
also
was
a
descendant
of
joseph
wherefore
heand
his
fathers
had
kept
the
records
nephi


and
now
when
my
father
saw
all
these
things
he
was
filledwith
the
spirit
and
began
to
prophesy
concerning
his
seed
nephi


that
these
plates
of
brass
should
go
forth
unto
all
nationskindreds
tongues
and
people
who
were
of
his
seed
nephi


wherefore
he
said
that
these
plates
of
brass
should
neverperish
neither
should
they
be
dimmed
any
more
by
time

and
heprophesied
many
things
concerning
his
seed
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
far
I
and
my
father
had
keptthe
commandments
wherewith
the
lord
had
commanded
us
nephi


and
we
had
obtained
the
records
which
the
lord
had
commandedus
and
searched
them
and
found
that
they
were
desirable
yeaeven
of
great
worth
unto
us
insomuch
that
we
could
preserve
thecommandments
of
the
lord
unto
our
children
nephi


wherefore
it
was
wisdom
in
the
lord
that
we
should
carrythem
with
us
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
towards
the
landof
promise
nephi

and
now
I
nephi
do
not
give
the
genealogy
of
my
fathers
inthis
part
of
my
record
neither
at
any
time
shall
I
give
it
afterupon
these

I
am
writing
for
it

given
in

been
kept
by
my

wherefore
I
do
notwrite
it
in

for
it
sufficeth
me
to
say
that
we
are
descendants
of
joseph

and
it
mattereth
not
to
me
that
I
am
particular
to
give
a
fullaccount
of
all
the
things
of
my
father
for
they
cannot
bewritten
upon

for
I
desire
the
room
that
I
may
writeof
the
things
of
god

for
the
fulness
of
mine
intent
is
that
I
may
persuade
men
tocome
unto
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
Isaac
and
the
godof
jacob
and
be
saved

wherefore
the

I
donot
write
but
the
things
which
are
pleasing
unto
god
and
untothose
who
are
not
of

wherefore
I
shall
give
commandment
unto

theyshall
not

and
now
I
would
that
ye
might
know
that
after
my
fatherlehi
had
made
an
end
of
prophesying
concerning
his
seed
it
cameto
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
him
again
saying
that
it
wasnot
meet
for
him
lehi
that
he
should
take
his
family
into
thewilderness
alone
but
that
his
sons
should
take
daughters
towife
that
they
might
raise
up
seed
unto
the
lord
in
the
land
ofpromise
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
commanded
him
that
I
nephiand
my
brethren
should
again
return
unto
the
land
of
jerusalemand
bring
down
Ishmael
and
his
family
into

and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
again
with
mybrethren
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
to
go
up
to
jerusalem
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
up
unto
the
house
of
Ishmaeland
we
did
gain
favor
in
the
sight
of
Ishmael
insomuch
that
wedid
speak
unto
him
the
words
of
the
lord
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
soften
the
heart
ofIshmael
and
also
his
household
insomuch
that
they
took
theirjourney
with
us
down
into
the
wilderness
to
the
tent
of
ourfather
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wildernessbehold
laman
and
lemuel
and
two
of
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
andthe
two
sons
of
Ishmael
and
their
families
did
rebel
against

against

their
father
Ishmael

it
came
to

which
rebellion
they
were
desirousto

land

and
now
I
nephi
being
grieved
for
the
hardness
of
theirhearts
therefore
I
spake
unto
them
saying
yea
even
unto
lamanand
unto
lemuel
behold
ye
are
mine
elder

and
how
is
itthat
ye
are
so
hard
in
your
hearts
and
so
blind
in
your
mindsthat
ye
have
need
that
I
your
younger
brother
should
speak
untoyou
yea
and
set
an
example
for
you
nephi


how
is
it
that
ye
have
not
hearkened
unto
the
word
of
thelord
nephi


how
is
it
that
ye
have
forgotten
that
ye
have
seen
an
angelof
the
lord
nephi


yea
and
how
is
it
that
ye
have
forgotten
what
great
thingsthe
lord
hath
done
for
us
in
delivering
us
out
of
the
hands
oflaban
and
also
that
we
should
obtain
the
record
nephi


yea
and
how
is
it
that
ye
have
forgotten
that
the
lord
isable
to
do
all
things
according
to
his
will
for
the
children
ofmen
if
it
so
be
that
they
exercise
faith
in
him

wherefore
letus
be
faithful
to
him
nephi


and
if
it
so
be
that
we
are
faithful
to
him
we
shall
obtainthe
land
of
promise
and
ye
shall
know
at
some
future
period
thatthe
word
of
the
lord
shall
be
fulfilled
concerning
thedestruction
of
jerusalem
for
all
things
which
the
lord
hathspoken
concerning
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
must
be
fulfilled
nephi


for
behold
the
spirit
of
the
lord
ceaseth
soon
to
strivewith
them
for
behold
they
have
rejected
the
prophets
andjeremiah
have
they
cast
into
prison

and
they
have
sought
totake
away
the
life
of
my
father
insomuch
that
they
have
drivenhim
out
of
the
land
nephi


now
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
will
return
untojerusalem
ye
shall
also
perish
with
them

and
now
if
ye
havechoice
go
up
to
the
land
and
remember
the
words
which
I
speakunto
you
that
if
ye
go
ye
will
also
perish
for
thus
the
spiritof
the
lord
constraineth
me
that
I
should
speak
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
nephi
had
spoken
thesewords
unto
my
brethren
they
were
angry
with
me

and
it
came
topass
that
they
did
lay
their
hands
upon
me
for
behold
they
wereexceedingly
wroth
and
they
did
bind
me
with
cords
for
theysought
to
take
away
my
life
that
they
might
leave
me
in
thewilderness
to
be
devoured
by
wild
beasts
nephi


but
it
came
to
pass
that
I
prayed
unto
the
lord
saying
olord
according
to
my
faith
which
is
in
thee
wilt
thou
deliverme
from
the
hands
of
my
brethren
yea
even
give
me
strength
thatI
may
burst
these
bands
with
which
I
am
bound
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
had
said
these
words
beholdthe
bands
were
loosed
from
off
my
hands
and
feet
and
I
stoodbefore
my
brethren
and
I
spake
unto
them
again
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
angry
with
me
again
andsought
to
lay
hands
upon
me
but
behold
one
of
the
daughters
ofIshmael
yea
and
also
her
mother
and
one
of
the
sons
ofIshmael
did
plead
with
my
brethren
insomuch
that
they
didsoften
their
hearts
and
they
did
cease
striving
to
take
away
mylife
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
sorrowful
because
oftheir
wickedness
insomuch
that
they
did
bow
down
before
me
anddid
plead
with
me
that
I
would
forgive
them
of
the
thing
thatthey
had
done
against
me
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
frankly
forgive
them
all
thatthey
had
done
and
I
did
exhort
them
that
they
would
pray
untothe
lord
their
god
for
forgiveness

and
it
came
to
pass
thatthey
did
so

and
after
they
had
done
praying
unto
the
lord
wedid
again
travel
on
our
journey
towards
the
tent
of
our
father
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
come
down
unto
the
tent
ofour
father

and
after
I
and
my
brethren
and
all
the
house
ofIshmael
had
come
down
unto
the
tent
of
my
father
they
did
givethanks
unto
the
lord
their
god
and
they
did
offer
sacrifice
andburnt
offerings
unto
him

nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
had
gathered
together
all
mannerof
seeds
of
every
kind
both
of
grain
of
every
kind
and
also
ofthe
seeds
of
fruit
of
every
kind
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
my
father
tarried
in
thewilderness
he
spake
unto
us
saying
behold
I
have
dreamed
adream
or
in
other
words
I
have
seen
a
vision
nephi


and
behold
because
of
the
thing
which
I
have
seen
I
havereason
to
rejoice
in
the
lord
because
of
nephi
and
also
of
samfor
I
have
reason
to
suppose
that
they
and
also
many
of
theirseed
will
be
saved
nephi


but
behold
laman
and
lemuel
I
fear
exceedingly
because
ofyou
for
behold
methought
I
saw
in
my
dream
a
dark
and
drearywilderness
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
a
man
and
he
was
dressed
in
awhite
robe
and
he
came
and
stood
before
me
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
me
and
bade
me
followhim
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
I
followed
him
I
beheld
myselfthat
I
was
in
a
dark
and
dreary
waste
nephi


and
after
I
had
traveled
for
the
space
of
many
hours
indarkness
I
began
to
pray
unto
the
lord
that
he
would
have
mercyon
me
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
tender
mercies
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
after
I
had
prayed
unto
the
lord
I
behelda
large
and
spacious
field
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
a
tree
whose
fruit
wasdesirable
to
make
one
happy
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
go
forth
and
partake
of
thefruit
thereof
and
I
beheld
that
it
was
most
sweet
above
allthat
I
ever
before
tasted

yea
and
I
beheld
that
the
fruitthereof
was
white
to
exceed
all
the
whiteness
that
I
had
everseen
nephi


and
as
I
partook
of
the
fruit
thereof
it
filled
my
soul
withexceedingly
great
joy
wherefore
I
began
to
be
desirous
that
myfamily
should
partake
of
it
also
for
I
knew
that
it
wasdesirable
above
all
other
fruit
nephi


and
as
I
cast
my
eyes
round
about
that
perhaps
I
mightdiscover
my
family
also
I
beheld
a
river
of
water
and
it
ranalong
and
it
was
near
the
tree
of
which
I
was
partaking
thefruit
nephi


and
I
looked
to
behold
from
whence
it
came
and
I
saw
thehead
thereof
a
little
way
off
and
at
the
head
thereof
I
beheldyour
mother
sariah
and
sam
and
nephi
and
they
stood
as
if
theyknew
not
whither
they
should
go
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beckoned
unto
them
and
I
also
didsay
unto
them
with
a
loud
voice
that
they
should
come
unto
meand
partake
of
the
fruit
which
was
desirable
above
all
otherfruit
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
unto
me
and
partake
ofthe
fruit
also
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
was
desirous
that
laman
and
lemuelshould
come
and
partake
of
the
fruit
also
wherefore
I
cast
mineeyes
towards
the
head
of
the
river
that
perhaps
I
might
seethem
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
them
but
they
would
not
comeunto
me
and
partake
of
the
fruit
nephi


and
I
beheld
a
rod
of
iron
and
it
extended
along
the
bank
ofthe
river
and
led
to
the
tree
by
which
I
stood
nephi


and
I
also
beheld
a
strait
and
narrow
path
which
came
alongby
the
rod
of
iron
even
to
the
tree
by
which
I
stood
and
italso
led
by
the
head
of
the
fountain
unto
a
large
and
spaciousfield
as
if
it
had
been
a
world
nephi


and
I
saw
numberless
concourses
of
people
many
of
whom
werepressing
forward
that
they
might
obtain
the
path
which
led
untothe
tree
by
which
I
stood
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
forth
and
commence
inthe
path
which
led
to
the
tree
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
a
mist
of
darkness
yeaeven
an
exceedingly
great
mist
of
darkness
insomuch
that
theywho
had
commenced
in
the
path
did
lose
their
way
that
theywandered
off
and
were
lost
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
others
pressing
forwardand
they
came
forth
and
caught
hold
of
the
end
of
the
rod
ofiron
and
they
did
press
forward
through
the
mist
of
darknessclinging
to
the
rod
of
iron
even
until
they
did
come
forth
andpartake
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
nephi


and
after
they
had
partaken
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
they
didcast
their
eyes
about
as
if
they
were
ashamed
nephi


and
I
also
cast
my
eyes
round
about
and
beheld
on
the
otherside
of
the
river
of
water
a
great
and
spacious
building
and
itstood
as
it
were
in
the
air
high
above
the
earth
nephi


and
it
was
filled
with
people
both
old
and
young
both
maleand
female
and
their
manner
of
dress
was
exceedingly
fine
andthey
were
in
the
attitude
of
mocking
and
pointing
their
fingerstowards
those
who
had
come
at
and
were
partaking
of
the
fruit
nephi


and
after
they
had
tasted
of
the
fruit
they
were
ashamedbecause
of
those
that
were
scoffing
at
them
and
they
fell
awayinto
forbidden
paths
and
were
lost
nephi


and
now
I
nephi
do
not
speak
all
the
words
of
my
father
nephi


but
to
be
short
in
writing
behold
he
saw
other
multitudespressing
forward
and
they
came
and
caught
hold
of
the
end
of
therod
of
iron
and
they
did
press
their
way
forward
continuallyholding
fast
to
the
rod
of
iron
until
they
came
forth
and
felldown
and
partook
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
nephi


and
he
also
saw
other
multitudes
feeling
their
way
towardsthat
great
and
spacious
building
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
many
were
drowned
in
the
depths
ofthe
fountain
and
many
were
lost
from
his
view
wandering
instrange
roads
nephi


and
great
was
the
multitude
that
did
enter
into
that
strangebuilding

and
after
they
did
enter
into
that
building
they
didpoint
the
finger
of
scorn
at
me
and
those
that
were
partaking
ofthe
fruit
also
but
we
heeded
them
not
nephi


these
are
the
words
of
my
father
for
as
many
as
heeded
themhad
fallen
away
nephi


and
laman
and
lemuel
partook
not
of
the
fruit
said
myfather
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
had
spoken
all
the
wordsof
his
dream
or
vision
which
were
many
he
said
unto
us
becauseof
these
things
which
he
saw
in
a
vision
he
exceedingly
fearedfor
laman
and
lemuel
yea
he
feared
lest
they
should
be
cast
offfrom
the
presence
of
the
lord
nephi


and
he
did
exhort
them
then
with
all
the
feeling
of
a
tenderparent
that
they
would
hearken
to
his
words
that
perhaps
thelord
would
be
merciful
to
them
and
not
cast
them
off
yea
myfather
did
preach
unto
them
nephi


and
after
he
had
preached
unto
them
and
also
prophesied
untothem
of
many
things
he
bade
them
to
keep
the
commandments
of
thelord
and
he
did
cease
speaking
unto
them
nephi

and
all
these
things
did
my
father
see
and
hear
and
speakas
he
dwelt
in
a
tent
in
the
valley
of
lemuel
and
also
a
greatmany
more
things
which
cannot
be
written
upon
these

and
now
as
I
have
spoken
concerning
these
plates
behold
theyare
not
the
plates
upon
which
I
make
a
full
account
of
thehistory
of
my
people
for
the
plates
upon
which
I
make
a
fullaccount
of

I
have
given
the

after
mine

nevertheless
I
have
received
a
commandment
of
the

that
Ishould
make
these

for
the
special
purpose
that
thereshould
be
an
account
engraven

upon
the

these

nephi


and
now
I
nephi
proceed
to
give
an
account
upon
these
platesof
my
proceedings
and
my
reign
and
ministry
wherefore
toproceed
with
mine
account
I
must
speak
somewhat
of
the
things
ofmy
father
and
also
of
my
brethren
nephi


for
behold
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
had
made
an
end
ofspeaking
the
words
of
his
dream
and
also
of
exhorting
them
toall
diligence
he
spake
unto
them
concerning
the
jews
nephi


that
after
they
should
be
destroyed
even
that
great
cityjerusalem
and
many
be
carried
away
captive
into
babylonaccording
to
the
own
due
time
of
the
lord
they
should
returnagain
yea
even
be
brought
back
out
of
captivity
and
after
theyshould
be
brought
back
out
of
captivity
they
should
possess
againthe
land
of
their
inheritance
nephi


yea
even
six
hundred
years
from
the
time
that
my
father
leftjerusalem
a
prophet
would
the
lord
god
raise
up
among
thejewseven
a
messiah
or
in
other
words
a
savior
of
the
world
nephi


and
he
also
spake
concerning
the
prophets
how
great
a
numberhad
testified
of
these
things
concerning
this
messiah
of
whomhe
had
spoken
or
this
redeemer
of
the
world
nephi


wherefore
all
mankind
were
in
a
lost
and
in
a
fallen
stateand
ever
would
be
save
they
should
rely
on
this
redeemer
nephi


and
he
spake
also
concerning
a
prophet
who
should
come
beforethe
messiah
to
prepare
the
way
of
the
lord
nephi


yea
even
he
should
go
forth
and
cry
in
the
wildernessprepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
and
make
his
paths
straight
forthere
standeth
one
among
you
whom
ye
know
not
and
he
is
mightierthan
I
whose
shoes
latchet
I
am
not
worthy
to
unloose

andmuch
spake
my
father
concerning
this
thing
nephi


and
my
father
said
he
should
baptize
in
bethabara
beyondjordan
and
he
also
said
he
should
baptize
with
water
even
thathe
should
baptize
the
messiah
with
water
nephi


and
after
he
had
baptized
the
messiah
with
water
he
shouldbehold
and
bear
record
that
he
had
baptized
the
lamb
of
god
whoshould
take
away
the
sins
of
the
world
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
had
spoken
these
words
hespake
unto
my
brethren
concerning
the
gospel
which
should
bepreached
among
the
jews
and
also
concerning
the
dwindling
of
thejews
in
unbelief

and
after
they
had
slain
the
messiah
whoshould
come
and
after
he
had
been
slain
he
should
rise
from
thedead
and
should
make
himself
manifest
by
the
holy
ghost
untothe
gentiles
nephi


yea
even
my
father
spake
much
concerning
the
gentiles
andalso
concerning
the
house
of
Israel
that
they
should
be
comparedlike
unto
an
olivetree
whose
branches
should
be
broken
off
andshould
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
nephi


wherefore
he
said
it
must
needs
be
that
we
should
be
ledwith
one
accord
into
the
land
of
promise
unto
the
fulfilling
ofthe
word
of
the
lord
that
we
should
be
scattered
upon
all
theface
of
the
earth
nephi


and
after
the
house
of
Israel
should
be
scattered
they
shouldbe
gathered
together
again
or
in
fine
after
the
gentiles
hadreceived
the
fulness
of
the

for
it
came
to
pass
after
I
had
desired
to
know
the
thingsthat
my

had
seen
and
believing
that
the
lord
was
able
tomake
them
known
unto
me
as
I
sat
pondering
in
mine
heart
I
wascaught
away
in
the
spirit
of
the
lord
yea
into
an
exceedinglyhigh
mountain
which
I
never
had
before
seen
and
upon
which
Inever
had
before
set
my
foot
nephi


and
the
spirit
said
unto
me
behold
what
desirest
thou
nephi


and
I
said
I
desire
to
behold
the
things
which
my

saw

said
unto

believest
thou
that

hath
spoken

and
I
said
yea
thou
knowest
that
I
believe
all
the
words
ofmy

and
when
I
had
spoken
these
words
the
spirit
cried
with
aloud
voice
saying
hosanna
to
the
lord
the
most
high
god
forhe
is
god
over
all
the
earth
yea
even
above

and
blessedart
thou

because
thou
believest
in

this

shall
be
given
unto
thee
for
a
signthat
after

the
fruit
whichthy

tasted
thou

behold
a

descending
out

him
shall

witness

it
came
to

said
unto

look

Ilooked
and

it
was
like
unto
the

the
beauty
thereof
was
far
beyond

the
whiteness
thereof
did
exceed
thewhiteness
of

said
unto

nephi


and
I
said
unto
him
to

the
interpretation
thereofforI
spake
unto

linen
and
all
manner
of
precious
clothing
and
I
sawmany
harlots
nephi


and
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
behold
the
gold
and
thesilver
and
the
silks
and
the
scarlets
and
the
finetwinedlinen
and
the
precious
clothing
and
the
harlots
are
thedesires
of
this
great
and
abominable
church
nephi


and
also
for
the
praise
of
the
world
do
they
destroy
thesaints
of
god
and
bring
them
down
into
captivity
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
looked
and
beheld
many
waters
andthey
divided
the
gentiles
from
the
seed
of
my
brethren
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
said
unto
me
behold
thewrath
of
god
is
upon
the
seed
of
thy
brethren
nephi


and
I
looked
and
beheld
a
man
among
the
gentiles
who
wasseparated
from
the
seed
of
my
brethren
by
the
many
waters
and
Ibeheld
the
spirit
of
god
that
it
came
down
and
wrought
upon
theman
and
he
went
forth
upon
the
many
waters
even
unto
the
seedof
my
brethren
who
were
in
the
promised
land
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
the
spirit
of
god
that
itwrought
upon
other
gentiles
and
they
went
forth
out
ofcaptivity
upon
the
many
waters
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
many
multitudes
of
thegentiles
upon
the
land
of
promise
and
I
beheld
the
wrath
of
godthat
it
was
upon
the
seed
of
my
brethren
and
they
were
scatteredbefore
the
gentiles
and
were
smitten
nephi


and
I
beheld
the
spirit
of
the
lord
that
it
was
upon
thegentiles
and
they
did
prosper
and
obtain
the
land
for
theirinheritance
and
I
beheld
that
they
were
white
and
exceedinglyfair
and
beautiful
like
unto
my
people
before
they
were
slain
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
beheld
that
the
gentileswho
had
gone
forth
out
of
captivity
did
humble
themselves
beforethe
lord
and
the
power
of
the
lord
was
with
them
nephi


and
I
beheld
that
their
mother
gentiles
were
gatheredtogether
upon
the
waters
and
upon
the
land
also
to
battleagainst
them
nephi


and
I
beheld
that
the
power
of
god
was
with
them
and
alsothat
the
wrath
of
god
was
upon
all
those
that
were
gatheredtogether
against
them
to
battle
nephi


and
I
nephi
beheld
that
the
gentiles
that
had
gone
out
ofcaptivity
were
delivered
by
the
power
of
god
out
of
the
hands
ofall
other
nations
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
beheld
that
they
didprosper
in
the
land
and
I
beheld
a
book
and
it
was
carriedforth
among
them
nephi


and
the
angel
said
unto
me
knowest
thou
the
meaning
of
thebook
nephi


and
I
said
unto
him
I
know
not
nephi


and
he
said
behold
it
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
jew
and
I
nephi
beheld
it
and
he
said
unto
me
the
book
that
thoubeholdest
is
a
record
of
the
jews
which
contains
the
covenantsof
the
lord
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
house
of
Israel
and
italso
containeth
many
of
the
prophecies
of
the
holy
prophets
andit
is
a
record
like
unto
the
engravings
which
are
upon
the
platesof
brass
save
there
are
not
so
many
nevertheless
they
containthe
covenants
of
the
lord
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
house
ofIsrael
wherefore
they
are
of
great
worth
unto
the
gentiles
nephi


and
the
angel
of
the
lord
said
unto
me
thou
hast
beheld
thatthe
book
proceeded
forth
from
the
mouth
of
a
jew
and
when
itproceeded
forth
from
the
mouth
of
a
jew
it
contained
the
fulnessof
the
gospel
of
the
lord
of
whom
the
twelve
apostles
bearrecord
and
they
bear
record
according
to
the
truth
which
is
inthe
lamb
of
god
nephi


wherefore
these
things
go
forth
from
the
jews
in
purity
untothe
gentiles
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
god
nephi


and
after
they
go
forth
by
the
hand
of
the
twelve
apostles
ofthe
lamb
from
the
jews
unto
the
gentiles
thou
seest
theformation
of
a
great
and
abominable
church
which
is
mostabominable
above
all
other
churches
for
behold
they
have
takenaway
from
the
gospel
of
the
lamb
many
parts
which
are
plain
andmost
precious
and
also
many
covenants
of
the
lord
have
theytaken
away
nephi


and
all
this
have
they
done
that
they
might
pervert
the
rightways
of
the
lord
that
they
might
blind
the
eyes
and
harden
thehearts
of
the
children
of
men
nephi


wherefore
thou
seest
that
after
the
book
hath
gone
forththrough
the
hands
of
the
great
and
abominable
church
that
thereare
many
plain
and
precious
things
taken
away
from
the
bookwhich
is
the
book
of
the
lamb
of

nephi


and
after
these
plain
and
precious
things
were
taken
away
itgoeth
forth
unto
all
the
nations
of
the
gentiles
and
after
itgoeth
forth
unto
all
the
nations
of
the
gentiles
yea
evenacross
the
many
waters
which
thou
hast
seen
with
the
gentileswhich
have
gone
forth
out
of
captivity
thou
seestbecause
ofthe
many
plain
and
precious
things
which
have
been
taken
out
ofthe
book
which
were
plain
unto
the
understanding
of
the
childrenof

according
to
the
plainness
which
is
in
the

of
these
things
which

an
exceedingly
great

stumble
yeainsomuch
that
satan
hath
great
power
over

nevertheless
thou
beholdest
that
the

who
have
goneforth
out

and
have
been
lifted
up
by
the
power
ofgod
above

land
that
the
lord
godhath
covenanted
with
thy
father
that
his
seed
should
have

wherefore
thou
seest
that
the

suffer
that

remain
in

also
into

both
temporallyand
spiritually
according
to
the
captivity
of
the

ofwhich
I
have
spoken
nephi


and
it
came
to

that
when
the

had
spoken
thesewords
he
said
unto

rememberest
thou
the
covenants
of

I
said
unto

nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
the
church
of
the
lamb
ofgod
and
its
numbers
were
few
because
of
the
wickedness
andabominations
of
the
whore
who
sat
upon

neverthelessI
beheld
that
the

also
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
and
their
dominionsupon

that
the

they
were
armedwith
righteousness
and
with
the
power
of

in
great
glory
nephi


and
it
came
to

waspoured
out
upon

abominable
church
insomuch
thatthere
were
wars

out

the
things
which

were
plain

precious

easy
to

behold
the
things
which
this
apostle
of

shallwrite
are
many
things
which
thou

seen
and
behold
theremainder

but
the
things
which
thou
shalt
see
hereafter
thou
shalt
notwrite
for
the
lord
god
hath
ordained
the
apostle
of
the
lamb
ofgod
that
he
should
write
them
nephi


and
also
others
who
have
been

them
hath

shown
allthings
and
they
have
written
them
and
they
are
sealed
up

the
truth
which
is
inthe

in
the
own
due
time
of
the
lord
unto
the

and
I
nephi
heard
and
bear
record
that
the
name
of
theapostle
of
the
lamb
was
john
according
to
the
word
of
the
angel
nephi


and
behold
I
nephi
am
forbidden
that
I
should
write
theremainder
of
the
things
which
I
saw
and
heard
wherefore
thethings
which
I
have
written
sufficeth
me
and
I
have
written
buta
small
part
of
the
things
which
I
saw
nephi


and
I
bear
record
that
I
saw
the
things
which
my
father
sawand
the
angel
of
the
lord
did
make
them
known
unto
me
nephi


and
now
I
make
an
end
of
speaking
concerning
the
things
whichI
saw
while
I
was
carried
away
in
the
spirit
and
if
all
thethings
which
I
saw
are
not
written
the
things
which
I
havewritten
are
true

and
thus
it
is

amen
nephi
chapter

nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
nephi
had
been
carried
awayin
the
spirit
and
seen
all
these
things
I
returned
to
the
tentof
my
father
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
my
brethren
and
they
weredisputing
one
with
another
concerning
the
things
my
father
hadspoken
unto
them
nephi


for
he
truly
spake
many
great
things
unto
them
which
werehard
to
be
understood
save
a
man
should
inquire
of
the
lord
andthey
being
hard
in
their
hearts
therefore
they
did
not
look
untothe
lord
as
they
ought
nephi


and
now
I
nephi
was
grieved
because
of
the
hardness
of
theirhearts
and
also
because
of
the
things
which
I
had
seen
andknew
they
must
unavoidably
come
to
pass
because
of
the
greatwickedness
of
the
children
of
men
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
was
overcome
because
of
myafflictions
for
I
considered
that
mine
afflictions
were
greatabove
all
because
of
the
destruction
of
my
people
for
I
hadbeheld
their
fall
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
had
received
strength
I
spakeunto
my
brethren
desiring
to
know
of
them
the
cause
of
theirdisputations
nephi


and
they
said
behold
we
cannot
understand
the
words
whichour
father
hath
spoken
concerning
the
natural
branches
of
theolivetree
and
also
concerning
the
gentiles
nephi


and
I
said
unto
them
have
ye
inquired
of
the
lord
nephi


and
they
said
unto
me
we
have
not
for
the
lord
maketh
nosuch
thing
known
unto
us
nephi


behold
I
said
unto
them
how
is
it
that
ye
do
not
keep
thecommandments
of
the
lord
how
is
it
that
ye
will
perish
becauseof
the
hardness
of
your
hearts
nephi


do
ye
not
remember
the
things
which
the
lord
hath
saidIfye
will
not
harden
your
hearts
and
ask
me
in
faith
believingthat
ye
shall
receive
with
diligence
in
keeping
my
commandmentssurely
these
things
shall
be
made
known
unto
you
nephi


behold
I
say
unto
you
that
the
house
of
Israel
was
comparedunto
an
olivetree
by
the
spirit
of
the
lord
which
was
in
ourfather
and
behold
are
we
not
broken
off
from
the
house
ofIsrael
and
are
we
not
a
branch
of
the
house
of
Israel
nephi


and
now
the
thing
which
our
father
meaneth
concerning
thegrafting
in
of
the
natural
branches
through
the
fulness
of
thegentiles
is
that
in
the
latter
days
when
our
seed
shall
havedwindled
in
unbelief
yea
for
the
space
of
many
years
and
manygenerations
after
the
messiah
shall
be
manifested
in
body
untothe
children
of
men
then
shall
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
of
themessiah
come
unto
the
gentiles
and
from
the
gentiles
unto
theremnant
of
our
seed
nephi


and
at
that
day
shall
the
remnant
of
our
seed
know
that
theyare
of
the
house
of
Israel
and
that
they
are
the
covenant
peopleof
the
lord
and
then
shall
they
know
and
come
to
the
knowledgeof
their
forefathers
and
also
to
the
knowledge
of
the
gospel
oftheir
redeemer
which
was
ministered
unto
their
fathers
by
himwherefore
they
shall
come
to
the
knowledge
of
their
redeemer
andthe
very
points
of
his
doctrine
that
they
may
know
how
to
comeunto
him
and
be
saved
nephi


and
then
at
that
day
will
they
not
rejoice
and
give
praiseunto
their
everlasting
god
their
rock
and
their
salvation
yeaat
that
day
will
they
not
receive
the
strength
and
nourishmentfrom
the
true
vine
yea
will
they
not
come
unto
the
true
fold
ofgod
nephi


behold
I
say
unto
you
yea
they
shall
be
remembered
againamong
the
house
of
Israel
they
shall
be
grafted
in
being
anatural
branch
of
the
olivetree
into
the
true
olivetree
nephi


and
this
is
what
our
father
meaneth
and
he
meaneth
that
itwill
not
come
to
pass
until
after
they
are
scattered
by
thegentiles
and
he
meaneth
that
it
shall
come
by
way
of
thegentiles
that
the
lord
may
show
his
power
unto
the
gentiles
forthe
very
cause
that
he
shall
be
rejected
of
the
jews
or
of
thehouse
of
Israel
nephi


wherefore
our
father
hath
not
spoken
of
our
seed
alone
butalso
of
all
the
house
of
Israel
pointing
to
the
covenant
whichshould
be
fulfilled
in
the
latter
days
which
covenant
the
lordmade
to
our
father
abraham
saying
In
thy
seed
shall
all
thekindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
spake
much
unto
themconcerning
these
things
yea
I
spake
unto
them
concerning
therestoration
of
the
jews
in
the
latter
days
nephi


and
I
did
rehearse
unto
them
the
words
of
Isaiah
who
spakeconcerning
the
restoration
of
the
jews
or
of
the
house
ofIsrael
and
after
they
were
restored
they
should
no
more
beconfounded
neither
should
they
be
scattered
again
and
it
cameto
pass
that
I
did
speak
many
words
unto
my
brethren
that
theywere
pacified
and
did
humble
themselves
before
the
lord
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
speak
unto
me
againsaying
what
meaneth
this
thing
which
our
father
saw
in
a
dreamwhat
meaneth
the
tree
which
he
saw
nephi


and
I
said
unto
them
It
was
a
representation
of
the
tree
oflife
nephi


and
they
said
unto
me
what
meaneth
the
rod
of
iron
which
ourfather
saw
that
led
to
the
tree
nephi


and
I
said
unto
them
that
it
was
the
word
of
god
and
whosewould
hearken
unto
the
word
of
god
and
would
hold
fast
unto
itthey
would
never
perish
neither
could
the
temptations
and
thefiery
darts
of
the
adversary
overpower
them
unto
blindness
tolead
them
away
to
destruction
nephi


wherefore
I
nephi
did
exhort
them
to
give
heed
unto
theword
of
the
lord
yea
I
did
exhort
them
with
all
the
energies
ofmy
soul
and
with
all
the
faculty
which
I
possessed
that
theywould
give
heed
to
the
word
of
god
and
remember
to
keep
hiscommandments
always
in
all
things
nephi


and
they
said
unto
me
what
meaneth
the
river
of
water
whichour
father
saw
nephi


and
I
said
unto
them
that
the
water
which
my
father
saw
wasfilthiness
and
so
much
was
his
mind
swallowed
up
in
other
thingsthat
he
beheld
not
the
filthiness
of
the
water
nephi


and
I
said
unto
them
that
it
was
an
awful
gulf
whichseparated
the
wicked
from
the
tree
of
life
and
also
from
thesaints
of
god
nephi


and
I
said
unto
them
that
it
was
a
representation
of
thatawful
hell
which
the
angel
said
unto
me
was
prepared
for
thewicked
nephi


and
I
said
unto
them
that
our
father
also
saw
that
thejustice
of
god
did
also
divide
the
wicked
from
the
righteous
andthe
brightness
thereof
was
like
unto
the
brightness
of
a
flamingfire
which
ascendeth
up
unto
god
forever
and
ever
and
hath
noend
nephi


and
they
said
unto
me
doth
this
thing
mean
the
torment
ofthe
body
in
the
days
of
probation
or
doth
it
mean
the
finalstate
of
the
soul
after
the
death
of
the
temporal
body
or
dothit
speak
of
the
things
which
are
temporal
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
said
unto
them
that
it
was
arepresentation
of
things
both
temporal
and
spiritual
for
the
dayshould
come
that
they
must
be
judged
of
their
works
yea
eventhe
works
which
were
done
by
the
temporal
body
in
their
days
ofprobation
nephi


wherefore
if
they
should
die
in
their
wickedness
they
mustbe
cast
off
also
as
to
the
things
which
are
spiritual
which
arepertaining
to
righteousness
wherefore
they
must
be
brought
tostand
before
god
to
be
judged
of
their
works
and
if
their
workshave
been
filthiness
they
must
needs
be
filthy
and
if
they
befilthy
it
must
needs
be
that
they
cannot
dwell
in
the
kingdom
ofgod
if
so
the
kingdom
of
god
must
be
filthy
also
nephi


but
behold
I
say
unto
you
the
kingdom
of
god
is
not
filthyand
there
cannot
any
unclean
thing
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
godwherefore
there
must
needs
be
a
place
of
filthiness
prepared
forthat
which
is
filthy
nephi


and
there
is
a
place
prepared
yea
even
that
awful
hell
ofwhich
I
have
spoken
and
the
devil
is
the
preparator
of
itwherefore
the
final
state
of
the
souls
of
men
is
to
dwell
in
thekingdom
of
god
or
to
be
cast
out
because
of
that
justice
ofwhich
I
have
spoken
nephi


wherefore
the
wicked
are
rejected
from
the
righteous
andalso
from
that
tree
of
life
whose
fruit
is
most
precious
andmost
desirable
above
all
other
fruits
yea
and
it
is
thegreatest
of
all
the
gifts
of
god
and
thus
I
spake
unto
mybrethren
amen
nephi
chapter

nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
nephi
had
made
an
endof
speaking
to
my
brethren
behold
they
said
unto
me
thou
hastdeclared
unto
us
hard
things
more
than
we
are
able
to
bear
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
said
unto
them
that
I
knew
that
Ihad
spoken
hard
things
against
the
wicked
according
to
thetruth
and
the
righteous
have
I
justified
and
testified
thatthey
should
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
wherefore
the
guiltytaketh
the
truth
to
be
hard
for
it
cutteth
them
to
the
verycenter
nephi


and
now
my
brethren
if
ye
were
righteous
and
were
willing
tohearken
to
the
truth
and
give
heed
unto
it
that
ye
might
walkuprightly
before
god
then
ye
would
not
murmur
because
of
thetruth
and
say
thou
speakest
hard
things
against
us
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
exhort
my
brethrenwith
all
diligence
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
humble
themselves
before
thelord
insomuch
that
I
had
joy
and
great
hopes
of
them
that
theywould
walk
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
nephi


now
all
these
things
were
said
and
done
as
my
father
dwelt
ina
tent
in
the
valley
which
he
called
lemuel
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
took
one
of
the
daughtersof
Ishmael
to
wife
and
also
my
brethren
took
of
the
daughtersof
Ishmael
to
wife
and
also
zoram
took
the
eldest
daughter
ofIshmael
to
wife
nephi


and
thus
my
father
had
fulfilled
all
the
commandments
of
thelord
which
had
been
given
unto
him

and
also
I
nephi
had
beenblessed
of
the
lord
exceedingly
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
spake
unto
myfather
by
night
and
commanded
him
that
on
the
morrow
he
shouldtake
his
journey
into
the
wilderness
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
my
father
arose
in
the
morningand
went
forth
to
the
tent
door
to
his
great
astonishment
hebeheld
upon
the
ground
a
round
ball
of
curious
workmanship
andit
was
of
fine
brass

and
within
the
ball
were
two
spindles
andthe
one
pointed
the
way
whither
we
should
go
into
the
wilderness
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
gather
together
whatsoeverthings
we
should
carry
into
the
wilderness
and
all
the
remainderof
our
provisions
which
the
lord
had
given
unto
us
and
we
didtake
seed
of
every
kind
that
we
might
carry
into
the
wilderness
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
take
our
tents
and
departinto
the
wilderness
across
the
river
laman
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
traveled
for
the
space
of
fourdays
nearly
a
southsoutheast
direction
and
we
did
pitch
ourtents
again
and
we
did
call
the
name
of
the
place
shazer
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
take
our
bows
and
our
arrowsand
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
to
slay
food
for
our
familiesand
after
we
had
slain
food
for
our
families
we
did
return
againto
our
families
in
the
wilderness
to
the
place
of
shazer

andwe
did
go
forth
again
in
the
wilderness
following
the
samedirection
keeping
in
the
most
fertile
parts
of
the
wildernesswhich
were
in
the
borders
near
the
red
sea
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
travel
for
the
space
of
manydays
slaying
food
by
the
way
with
our
bows
and
our
arrows
andour
stones
and
our
slings
nephi


and
we
did
follow
the
directions
of
the
ball
which
led
us
inthe
more
fertile
parts
of
the
wilderness
nephi


and
after
we
had
traveled
for
the
space
of
many
days
we
didpitch
our
tents
for
the
space
of
a
time
that
we
might
again
restourselves
and
obtain
food
for
our
families
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
I
nephi
went
forth
to
slayfood
behold
I
did
break
my
bow
which
was
made
of
fine
steeland
after
I
did
break
my
bow
behold
my
brethren
were
angry
withme
because
of
the
loss
of
my
bow
for
we
did
obtain
no
food
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
return
without
food
to
ourfamilies
and
being
much
fatigued
because
of
their
journeyingthey
did
suffer
much
for
the
want
of
food
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
laman
and
lemuel
and
the
sons
ofIshmael
did
begin
to
murmur
exceedingly
because
of
theirsufferings
and
afflictions
in
the
wilderness
and
also
my
fatherbegan
to
murmur
against
the
lord
his
god
yea
and
they
were
allexceedingly
sorrowful
even
that
they
did
murmur
against
thelord
nephi


now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
having
been
afflicted
withmy
brethren
because
of
the
loss
of
my
bow
and
their
bows
havinglost
their
springs
it
began
to
be
exceedingly
difficult
yeainsomuch
that
we
could
obtain
no
food
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
speak
much
unto
mybrethren
because
they
had
hardened
their
hearts
again
even
untocomplaining
against
the
lord
their
god
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
make
out
of
wood
abow
and
out
of
a
straight
stick
an
arrow
wherefore
I
did
armmyself
with
a
bow
and
an
arrow
with
a
sling
and
with
stones
and
I
said
unto
my
father
whither
shall
I
go
to
obtain
food
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
inquire
of
the
lord
for
theyhad
humbled
themselves
because
of
my
words
for
I
did
say
manythings
unto
them
in
the
energy
of
my
soul
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
myfather
and
he
was
truly
chastened
because
of
his
murmuringagainst
the
lord
insomuch
that
he
was
brought
down
into
thedepths
of
sorrow
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
said
unto
himlook
upon
the
ball
and
behold
the
things
which
are
written
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
beheld
the
thingswhich
were
written
upon
the
ball
he
did
fear
and
trembleexceedingly
and
also
my
brethren
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
and
ourwives
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
beheld
the
pointers
whichwere
in
the
ball
that
they
did
work
according
to
the
faith
anddiligence
and
heed
which
we
did
give
unto
them
nephi


and
there
was
also
written
upon
them
a
new
writing
which
wasplain
to
be
read
which
did
give
us
understanding
concerning
theways
of
the
lord
and
it
was
written
and
changed
from
time
totime
according
to
the
faith
and
diligence
which
we
gave
unto
itand
thus
we
see
that
by
small
means
the
lord
can
bring
aboutgreat
things
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
go
forth
up
into
thetop
of
the
mountain
according
to
the
directions
which
were
givenupon
the
ball
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
slay
wild
beasts
insomuchthat
I
did
obtain
food
for
our
families
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
return
to
our
tents
bearingthe
beasts
which
I
had
slain
and
now
when
they
beheld
that
I
hadobtained
food
how
great
was
their
joy

and
it
came
to
pass
thatthey
did
humble
themselves
before
the
lord
and
did
give
thanksunto
him
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
again
take
our
journeytraveling
nearly
the
same
course
as
in
the
beginning
and
afterwe
had
traveled
for
the
space
of
many
days
we
did
pitch
our
tentsagain
that
we
might
tarry
for
the
space
of
a
time
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
Ishmael
died
and
was
buried
in
theplace
which
was
called
nahom
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
did
mournexceedingly
because
of
the
loss
of
their
father
and
because
oftheir
afflictions
in
the
wilderness
and
they
did
murmur
againstmy
father
because
he
had
brought
them
out
of
the
land
ofjerusalem
saying
our
father
is
dead
yea
and
we
have
wanderedmuch
in
the
wilderness
and
we
have
suffered
much
afflictionhunger
thirst
and
fatigue
and
after
all
these
sufferings
wemust
perish
in
the
wilderness
with
hunger
nephi


and
thus
they
did
murmur
against
my
father
and
also
againstme
and
they
were
desirous
to
return
again
to
jerusalem
nephi


and
laman
said
unto
lemuel
and
also
unto
the
sons
of
Ishmaelbehold
let
us
slay
our
father
and
also
our
brother
nephi
whohas
taken
it
upon
him
to
be
our
ruler
and
our
teacher
who
arehis
elder
brethren
nephi


now
he
says
that
the
lord
has
talked
with
him
and
also
thatangels
have
ministered
unto
him

but
behold
we
know
that
helies
unto
us
and
he
tells
us
these
things
and
he
worketh
manythings
by
his
cunning
arts
that
he
may
deceive
our
eyesthinking
perhaps
that
he
may
lead
us
away
into
some
strangewilderness
and
after
he
has
led
us
away
he
has
thought
to
makehimself
a
king
and
a
ruler
over
us
that
he
may
do
with
usaccording
to
his
will
and
pleasure

and
after
this
manner
did
mybrother
laman
stir
up
their
hearts
to
anger
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
was
with
us
yea
even
thevoice
of
the
lord
came
and
did
speak
many
words
unto
them
anddid
chasten
them
exceedingly
and
after
they
were
chastened
bythe
voice
of
the
lord
they
did
turn
away
their
anger
and
didrepent
of
their
sins
insomuch
that
the
lord
did
bless
us
againwith
food
that
we
did
not
perish
nephi
chapter

nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
again
take
our
journey
in
thewilderness
and
we
did
travel
nearly
eastward
from
that
timeforth

and
we
did
travel
and
wade
through
much
affliction
in
thewilderness
and
our
women
did
bear
children
in
the
wilderness
nephi


and
so
great
were
the
blessings
of
the
lord
upon
us
thatwhile
we
did
live
upon
raw
meat
in
the
wilderness
our
women
didgive
plenty
of
suck
for
their
children
and
were
strong
yeaeven
like
unto
the
men
and
they
began
to
bear
their
journeyingswithout
murmurings
nephi


and
thus
we
see
that
the
commandments
of
god
must
befulfilled

and
if
it
so
be
that
the
children
of
men
keep
thecommandments
of
god
he
doth
nourish
them
and
strengthen
themand
provide
means
whereby
they
can
accomplish
the
thing
which
hehas
commanded
them
wherefore
he
did
provide
means
for
us
whilewe
did
sojourn
in
the
wilderness
nephi


and
we
did
sojourn
for
the
space
of
many
years
yea
eveneight
years
in
the
wilderness
nephi


and
we
did
come
to
the
land
which
we
called
bountiful
becauseof
its
much
fruit
and
also
wild
honey
and
all
these
things
wereprepared
of
the
lord
that
we
might
not
perish

and
we
beheld
thesea
which
we
called
Irreantum
which
being
interpreted
is
manywaters
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
pitch
our
tents
by
theseashore
and
notwithstanding
we
had
suffered
many
afflictionsand
much
difficulty
yea
even
so
much
that
we
cannot
write
themall
we
were
exceedingly
rejoiced
when
we
came
to
the
seashoreand
we
called
the
place
bountiful
because
of
its
much
fruit
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
nephi
had
been
in
the
landof
bountiful
for
the
space
of
many
days
the
voice
of
the
lordcame
unto
me
saying
arise
and
get
thee
into
the
mountain

andit
came
to
pass
that
I
arose
and
went
up
into
the
mountain
andcried
unto
the
lord
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
me
saying
thoushalt
construct
a
ship
after
the
manner
which
I
shall
show
theethat
I
may
carry
thy
people
across
these
waters
nephi


and
I
said
lord
whither
shall
I
go
that
I
may
find
ore
tomolten
that
I
may
make
tools
to
construct
the
ship
after
themanner
which
thou
hast
shown
unto
me
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
told
me
whither
I
should
goto
find
ore
that
I
might
make
tools
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
make
a
bellowswherewith
to
blow
the
fire
of
the
skins
of
beasts
and
after
Ihad
made
a
bellows
that
I
might
have
wherewith
to
blow
the
fireI
did
smite
two
stones
together
that
I
might
make
fire
nephi


for
the
lord
had
not
hitherto
suffered
that
we
should
makemuch
fire
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
for
he
said
I
willmake
thy
food
become
sweet
that
ye
cook
it
not
nephi


and
I
will
also
be
your
light
in
the
wilderness
and
I
willprepare
the
way
before
you
if
it
so
be
that
ye
shall
keep
mycommandments
wherefore
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
mycommandments
ye
shall
be
led
towards
the
promised
land
and
yeshall
know
that
it
is
by
me
that
ye
are
led
nephi


yea
and
the
lord
said
also
that
after
ye
have
arrived
inthe
promised
land
ye
shall
know
that
I
the
lord
am
god
andthat
I
the
lord
did
deliver
you
from
destruction
yea
that
Idid
bring
you
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
nephi


wherefore
I
nephi
did
strive
to
keep
the
commandments
ofthe
lord
and
I
did
exhort
my
brethren
to
faithfulness
anddiligence
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
make
tools
of
the
ore
which
Idid
molten
out
of
the
rock
nephi


and
when
my
brethren
saw
that
I
was
about
to
build
a
shipthey
began
to
murmur
against
me
saying
our
brother
is
a
foolfor
he
thinketh
that
he
can
build
a
ship
yea
and
he
alsothinketh
that
he
can
cross
these
great
waters
nephi


and
thus
my
brethren
did
complain
against
me
and
weredesirous
that
they
might
not
labor
for
they
did
not
believe
thatI
could
build
a
ship
neither
would
they
believe
that
I
wasinstructed
of
the
lord
nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
was
exceedinglysorrowful
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
now
whenthey
saw
that
I
began
to
be
sorrowful
they
were
glad
in
theirhearts
insomuch
that
they
did
rejoice
over
me
saying
we
knewthat
ye
could
not
construct
a
ship
for
we
knew
that
ye
werelacking
in
judgment
wherefore
thou
canst
not
accomplish
sogreat
a
work
nephi


and
thou
art
like
unto
our
father
led
away
by
the
foolishimaginations
of
his
heart
yea
he
hath
led
us
out
of
the
land
ofjerusalem
and
we
have
wandered
in
the
wilderness
for
these
manyyears
and
our
women
have
toiled
being
big
with
child
and
theyhave
borne
children
in
the
wilderness
and
suffered
all
thingssave
it
were
death
and
it
would
have
been
better
that
they
haddied
before
they
came
out
of
jerusalem
than
to
have
sufferedthese
afflictions
nephi


behold
these
many
years
we
have
suffered
in
the
wildernesswhich
time
we
might
have
enjoyed
our
possessions
and
the
land
ofour
inheritance
yea
and
we
might
have
been
happy
nephi


and
we
know
that
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
jerusalemwere
a
righteous
people
for
they
kept
the
statutes
and
judgmentsof
the
lord
and
all
his
commandments
according
to
the
law
ofmoses
wherefore
we
know
that
they
are
a
righteous
people
andour
father
hath
judged
them
and
hath
led
us
away
because
wewould
hearken
unto
his
words
yea
and
our
brother
is
like
untohim

and
after
this
manner
of
language
did
my
brethren
murmurand
complain
against
us
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
spake
unto
them
sayingdo
ye
believe
that
our
fathers
who
were
the
children
of
Israelwould
have
been
led
away
out
of
the
hands
of
the
egyptians
ifthey
had
not
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
the
lord
nephi


yea
do
ye
suppose
that
they
would
have
been
led
out
ofbondage
if
the
lord
had
not
commanded
moses
that
he
should
leadthem
out
of
bondage
nephi


now
ye
know
that
the
children
of
Israel
were
in
bondage
andye
know
that
they
were
laden
with
tasks
which
were
grievous
tobe
borne
wherefore
ye
know
that
it
must
needs
be
a
good
thingfor
them
that
they
should
be
brought
out
of
bondage
nephi


now
ye
know
that
moses
was
commanded
of
the
lord
to
do
thatgreat
work
and
ye
know
that
by
his
word
the
waters
of
the
redsea
were
divided
hither
and
thither
and
they
passed
through
ondry
ground
nephi


but
ye
know
that
the
egyptians
were
drowned
in
the
red
seawho
were
the
armies
of
pharaoh
nephi


and
ye
also
know
that
they
were
fed
with
manna
in
thewilderness
nephi


yea
and
ye
also
know
that
moses
by
his
word
according
tothe
power
of
god
which
was
in
him
smote
the
rock
and
there
cameforth
water
that
the
children
of
Israel
might
quench
theirthirst
nephi


and
notwithstanding
they
being
led
the
lord
their
god
theirredeemer
going
before
them
leading
them
by
day
and
giving
lightunto
them
by
night
and
doing
all
things
for
them
which
wereexpedient
for
man
to
receive
they
hardened
their
hearts
andblinded
their
minds
and
reviled
against
moses
and
against
thetrue
and
living
god
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
according
to
his
word
he
did
destroythem
and
according
to
his
word
he
did
lead
them
and
accordingto
his
word
he
did
do
all
things
for
them
and
there
was
not
anything
done
save
it
were
by
his
word
nephi


and
after
they
had
crossed
the
river
jordan
he
did
make
themmighty
unto
the
driving
out
of
the
children
of
the
land
yeaunto
the
scattering
them
to
destruction
nephi


and
now
do
ye
suppose
that
the
children
of
this
land
whowere
in
the
land
of
promise
who
were
driven
out
by
our
fathersdo
ye
suppose
that
they
were
righteous

behold
I
say
unto
younay
nephi


do
ye
suppose
that
our
fathers
would
have
been
more
choicethan
they
if
they
had
been
righteous

I
say
unto
you
nay
nephi


behold
the
lord
esteemeth
all
flesh
in
one
he
that
isrighteous
is
favored
of
god

but
behold
this
people
hadrejected
every
word
of
god
and
they
were
ripe
in
iniquity
andthe
fulness
of
the
wrath
of
god
was
upon
them
and
the
lord
didcurse
the
land
against
them
and
bless
it
unto
our
fathers
yeahe
did
curse
it
against
them
unto
their
destruction
and
he
didbless
it
unto
our
fathers
unto
their
obtaining
power
over
it
nephi


behold
the
lord
hath
created
the
earth
that
it
should
beinhabited
and
he
hath
created
his
children
that
they
shouldpossess
it
nephi


and
he
raiseth
up
a
righteous
nation
and
destroyeth
thenations
of
the
wicked
nephi


and
he
leadeth
away
the
righteous
into
precious
lands
andthe
wicked
he
destroyeth
and
curseth
the
land
unto
them
fortheir
sakes
nephi


he
ruleth
high
in
the
heavens
for
it
is
his
throne
and
thisearth
is
his
footstool
nephi


and
he
loveth
those
who
will
have
him
to
be
their
god
behold
he
loved
our
fathers
and
he
covenanted
with
them
yeaeven
abraham
Isaac
and
jacob
and
he
remembered
the
covenantswhich
he
had
made
wherefore
he
did
bring
them
out
of
the
landof
egypt
nephi


and
he
did
straiten
them
in
the
wilderness
with
his
rod
forthey
hardened
their
hearts
even
as
ye
have
and
the
lordstraitened
them
because
of
their
iniquity

he
sent
fiery
flyingserpents
among
them
and
after
they
were
bitten
he
prepared
a
waythat
they
might
be
healed
and
the
labor
which
they
had
toperform
was
to
look
and
because
of
the
simpleness
of
the
way
orthe
easiness
of
it
there
were
many
who
perished
nephi


and
they
did
harden
their
hearts
from
time
to
time
and
theydid
revile
against
moses
and
also
against
god
nevertheless
yeknow
that
they
were
led
forth
by
his
matchless
power
into
theland
of
promise
nephi


and
now
after
all
these
things
the
time
has
come
that
theyhave
become
wicked
yea
nearly
unto
ripeness
and
I
know
not
butthey
are
at
this
day
about
to
be
destroyed
for
I
know
that
theday
must
surely
come
that
they
must
be
destroyed
save
a
fewonly
who
shall
be
led
away
into
captivity
nephi


wherefore
the
lord
commanded
my
father
that
he
should
departinto
the
wilderness
and
the
jews
also
sought
to
take
away
hislife
yea
and
ye
also
have
sought
to
take
away
his
lifewherefore
ye
are
murderers
in
your
hearts
and
ye
are
like
untothem
nephi


ye
are
swift
to
do
iniquity
but
slow
to
remember
the
lordyour
god

ye
have
seen
an
angel
and
he
spake
unto
you
yea
yehave
heard
his
voice
from
time
to
time
and
he
hath
spoken
untoyou
in
a
still
small
voice
but
ye
were
past
feeling
that
yecould
not
feel
his
words
wherefore
he
has
spoken
unto
you
likeunto
the
voice
of
thunder
which
did
cause
the
earth
to
shake
asif
it
were
to
divide
asunder
nephi


and
ye
also
know
that
by
the
power
of
his
almighty
word
hecan
cause
the
earth
that
it
shall
pass
away
yea
and
ye
knowthat
by
his
word
he
can
cause
the
rough
places
to
be
made
smoothand
smooth
places
shall
be
broken
up

o
then
why
is
it
thatye
can
be
so
hard
in
your
hearts
nephi


behold
my
soul
is
rent
with
anguish
because
of
you
and
myheart
is
pained
I
fear
lest
ye
shall
be
cast
off
forever
behold
I
am
full
of
the
spirit
of
god
insomuch
that
my
framehas
no
strength
nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
had
spoken
these
wordsthey
were
angry
with
me
and
were
desirous
to
throw
me
into
thedepths
of
the
sea
and
as
they
came
forth
to
lay
their
hands
uponme
I
spake
unto
them
saying
In
the
name
of
the
almighty
god
Icommand
you
that
ye
touch
me
not
for
I
am
filled
with
the
powerof
god
even
unto
the
consuming
of
my
flesh
and
whoso
shall
layhis
hands
upon
me
shall
wither
even
as
a
dried
reed
and
he
shallbe
as
naught
before
the
power
of
god
for
god
shall
smite
him
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
said
unto
them
that
theyshould
murmur
no
more
against
their
father
neither
should
theywithhold
their
labor
from
me
for
god
had
commanded
me
that
Ishould
build
a
ship
nephi


and
I
said
unto
them
If
god
had
commanded
me
to
do
allthings
I
could
do
them

If
he
should
command
me
that
I
shouldsay
unto
this
water
be
thou
earth
it
should
be
earth
and
if
Ishould
say
it
it
would
be
done
nephi


and
now
if
the
lord
has
such
great
power
and
has
wrought
somany
miracles
among
the
children
of
men
how
is
it
that
he
cannotinstruct
me
that
I
should
build
a
ship
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
said
many
things
unto
mybrethren
insomuch
that
they
were
confounded
and
could
notcontend
against
me
neither
durst
they
lay
their
hands
upon
menor
touch
me
with
their
fingers
even
for
the
space
of
many
daysnow
they
durst
not
do
this
lest
they
should
wither
before
me
sopowerful
was
the
spirit
of
god
and
thus
it
had
wrought
uponthem
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
said
unto
me
stretch
forththine
hand
again
unto
thy
brethren
and
they
shall
not
witherbefore
thee
but
I
will
shock
them
saith
the
lord
and
this
willI
do
that
they
may
know
that
I
am
the
lord
their
god
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
stretched
forth
my
hand
unto
mybrethren
and
they
did
not
wither
before
me
but
the
lord
didshake
them
even
according
to
the
word
which
he
had
spoken
nephi


and
now
they
said
we
know
of
a
surety
that
the
lord
is
withthee
for
we
know
that
it
is
the
power
of
the
lord
that
hasshaken
us

and
they
fell
down
before
me
and
were
about
toworship
me
but
I
would
not
suffer
them
saying
I
am
thybrother
yea
even
thy
younger
brother
wherefore
worship
thelord
thy
god
and
honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
that
thy
daysmay
be
long
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
shall
give
thee
nephi
chapter

nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
worship
the
lord
and
did
goforth
with
me
and
we
did
work
timbers
of
curious
workmanship
and
the
lord
did
show
me
from
time
to
time
after
what
manner
Ishould
work
the
timbers
of
the
ship
nephi


now
I
nephi
did
not
work
the
timbers
after
the
manner
whichwas
learned
by
men
neither
did
I
build
the
ship
after
the
mannerof
men
but
I
did
build
it
after
the
manner
which
the
lord
hadshown
unto
me
wherefore
it
was
not
after
the
manner
of
men
nephi


and
I
nephi
did
go
into
the
mount
oft
and
I
did
pray
oftunto
the
lord
wherefore
the
lord
showed
unto
me
great
things
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
had
finished
the
shipaccording
to
the
word
of
the
lord
my
brethren
beheld
that
it
wasgood
and
that
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceedingly
finewherefore
they
did
humble
themselves
again
before
the
lord
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
myfather
that
we
should
arise
and
go
down
into
the
ship
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
after
we
had
preparedall
things
much
fruits
and
meat
from
the
wilderness
and
honeyin
abundance
and
provisions
according
to
that
which
the
lord
hadcommanded
us
we
did
go
down
into
the
ship
with
all
our
loadingand
our
seeds
and
whatsoever
thing
we
had
brought
with
us
everyone
according
to
his
age
wherefore
we
did
all
go
down
into
theship
with
our
wives
and
our
children
nephi


and
now
my
father
had
begat
two
sons
in
the
wilderness
theelder
was
called
jacob
and
the
younger
joseph
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
after
we
had
all
gone
down
into
the
shipand
had
taken
with
us
our
provisions
and
things
which
had
beencommanded
us
we
did
put
forth
into
the
sea
and
were
driven
forthbefore
the
wind
towards
the
promised
land
nephi


and
after
we
had
been
driven
forth
before
the
wind
for
thespace
of
many
days
behold
my
brethren
and
the
sons
of
Ishmaeland
also
their
wives
began
to
make
themselves
merry
insomuchthat
they
began
to
dance
and
to
sing
and
to
speak
with
muchrudeness
yea
even
that
they
did
forget
by
what
power
they
hadbeen
brought
thither
yea
they
were
lifted
up
unto
exceedingrudeness
nephi


and
I
nephi
began
to
fear
exceedingly
lest
the
lord
shouldbe
angry
with
us
and
smite
us
because
of
our
iniquity
that
weshould
be
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
wherefore
Inephi
began
to
speak
to
them
with
much
soberness
but
beholdthey
were
angry
with
me
saying
we
will
not
that
our
youngerbrother
shall
be
a
ruler
over
us
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
laman
and
lemuel
did
take
me
andbind
me
with
cords
and
they
did
treat
me
with
much
harshnessnevertheless
the
lord
did
suffer
it
that
he
might
show
forth
hispower
unto
the
fulfilling
of
his
word
which
he
had
spokenconcerning
the
wicked
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
bound
me
insomuchthat
I
could
not
move
the
compass
which
had
been
prepared
ofthe
lord
did
cease
to
work
nephi


wherefore
they
knew
not
whither
they
should
steer
the
shipinsomuch
that
there
arose
a
great
storm
yea
a
great
andterrible
tempest
and
we
were
driven
back
upon
the
waters
for
thespace
of
three
days
and
they
began
to
be
frightened
exceedinglylest
they
should
be
drowned
in
the
sea
nevertheless
they
did
notloose
me
nephi


and
on
the
fourth
day
which
we
had
been
driven
back
thetempest
began
to
be
exceedingly
sore
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
were
about
to
be
swallowed
up
inthe
depths
of
the
sea

and
after
we
had
been
driven
back
uponthe
waters
for
the
space
of
four
days
my
brethren
began
to
seethat
the
judgments
of
god
were
upon
them
and
that
they
mustperish
save
that
they
should
repent
of
their
iniquitieswherefore
they
came
unto
me
and
loosed
the
bands
which
wereupon
my
wrist
and
behold
they
had
swollen
exceedingly
and
alsomine
ankles
were
much
swollen
and
great
was
the
sorenessthereof
nephi


nevertheless
I
did
look
unto
my
god
and
I
did
praise
himall
the
day
long
and
I
did
not
murmur
against
the
lord
becauseof
mine
afflictions
nephi


now
my
father
lehi
had
said
many
things
unto
them
and
alsounto
the
sons
of
Ishmael
but
behold
they
did
breathe
out
muchthreatenings
against
anyone
that
should
speak
for
me
and
myparents
being
stricken
in
years
and
having
suffered
much
griefbecause
of
their
children
they
were
brought
down
yea
even
upontheir
sickbeds
nephi


because
of
their
grief
and
much
sorrow
and
the
iniquity
ofmy
brethren
they
were
brought
near
even
to
be
carried
out
ofthis
time
to
meet
their
god
yea
their
grey
hairs
were
about
tobe
brought
down
to
lie
low
in
the
dust
yea
even
they
were
nearto
be
cast
with
sorrow
into
a
watery
grave
nephi


and
jacob
and
joseph
also
being
young
having
need
of
muchnourishment
were
grieved
because
of
the
afflictions
of
theirmother
and
also
my
wife
with
her
tears
and
prayers
and
also
mychildren
did
not
soften
the
hearts
of
my
brethren
that
theywould
loose
me
nephi


and
there
was
nothing
save
it
were
the
power
of
god
whichthreatened
them
with
destruction
could
soften
their
heartswherefore
when
they
saw
that
they
were
about
to
be
swallowed
upin
the
depths
of
the
sea
they
repented
of
the
thing
which
theyhad
done
insomuch
that
they
loosed
me
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
loosed
me
behold
I
tookthe
compass
and
it
did
work
whither
I
desired
it

and
it
cameto
pass
that
I
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
after
I
had
prayed
thewinds
did
cease
and
the
storm
did
cease
and
there
was
a
greatcalm
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
guide
the
ship
thatwe
sailed
again
towards
the
promised
land
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
sailed
for
the
space
ofmany
days
we
did
arrive
at
the
promised
land
and
we
went
forthupon
the
land
and
did
pitch
our
tents
and
we
did
call
it
thepromised
land
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
begin
to
till
the
earth
andwe
began
to
plant
seeds
yea
we
did
put
all
our
seeds
into
theearth
which
we
had
brought
from
the
land
of
jerusalem

and
itcame
to
pass
that
they
did
grow
exceedingly
wherefore
we
wereblessed
in
abundance
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
find
upon
the
land
ofpromise
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
that
there
werebeasts
in
the
forests
of
every
kind
both
the
cow
and
the
ox
andthe
ass
and
the
horse
and
the

and
the
wild

and
allmanner
of
wild
animals
which
were
for
the
use
of
men

and
wedid
find
all

of

nephi
chapter

nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
commanded
me
wherefore
Idid
make
plates
of
ore
that
I
might
engraven
upon
them
the
recordof
my
people

and
upon
the
plates
which
I
made
I
did
engraventhe
record
of
my
father
and
also
our
journeyings
in
thewilderness
and
the
prophecies
of
my
father
and
also
many
ofmine
own
prophecies
have
I
engraven
upon
them
nephi


and
I
knew
not
at
the
time
when
I
made
them
that
I
should
becommanded
of
the
lord
to
make
these
plates
wherefore
the
recordof
my
father
and
the
genealogy
of
his
fathers
and
the
more
partof
all
our
proceedings
in
the
wilderness
are
engraven
upon
thosefirst
plates
of
which
I
have
spoken
wherefore
the
things
whichtranspired
before
I
made
these
plates
are
of
a
truth
moreparticularly
made
mention
upon
the
first
plates
nephi


and
after
I
had
made
these
plates
by
way
of
commandment
Inephi
received
a
commandment
that
the
ministry
and
theprophecies
the
more
plain
and
precious
parts
of
them
should
bewritten
upon
these
plates
and
that
the
things
which
were
writtenshould
be
kept
for
the
instruction
of
my
people
who
shouldpossess
the
land
and
also
for
other
wise
purposes
whichpurposes
are
known
unto
the
lord
nephi


wherefore
I
nephi
did
make
a
record
upon
the
other
plateswhich
gives
an
account
or
which
gives
a
greater
account
of
thewars
and
contentions
and
destructions
of
my
people

and
thishave
I
done
and
commanded
my
people
what
they
should
do
after
Iwas
gone
and
that
these
plates
should
be
handed
down
from
onegeneration
to
another
or
from
one
prophet
to
another
untilfurther
commandments
of
the
lord
nephi


and
an
account
of
my
making
these
plates
shall
be
givenhereafter
and
then
behold
I
proceed
according
to
that
which
Ihave
spoken
and
this
I
do
that
the
more
sacred
things
may
bekept
for
the
knowledge
of
my
people
nephi


nevertheless
I
do
not
write
anything
upon
plates
save
it
bethat
I
think
it
be
sacred

and
now
if
I
do
err
even
did
theyerr
of
old
not
that
I
would
excuse
myself
because
of
other
menbut
because
of
the
weakness
which
is
in
me
according
to
theflesh
I
would
excuse
myself
nephi


for
the
things
which
some
men
esteem
to
be
of
great
worthboth
to
the
body
and
soul
others
set
at
naught
and
trample
undertheir
feet

yea
even
the
very
god
of
Israel
do
men
trampleunder
their
feet
I
say
trample
under
their
feet
but
I
wouldspeak
in
other
wordsthey
set
him
at
naught
and
hearken
not
tothe
voice
of
his
counsels
nephi


and
behold
he
cometh
according
to
the
words
of
the
angel
insix
hundred
years
from
the
time
my
father
left
jerusalem
nephi


and
the
world
because
of
their
iniquity
shall
judge
him
tobe
a
thing
of
naught
wherefore
they
scourge
him
and
hesuffereth
it
and
they
smite
him
and
he
suffereth
it

yea
theyspit
upon
him
and
he
suffereth
it
because
of
his
lovingkindness
and
his
longsuffering
towards
the
children
of
men
nephi


and
the
god
of
our
fathers
who
were
led
out
of
egypt
out
ofbondage
and
also
were
preserved
in
the
wilderness
by
him
yeathe
god
of
abraham
and
of
Isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
yieldethhimself
according
to
the
words
of
the
angel
as
a
man
into
thehands
of
wicked
men
to
be
lifted
up
according
to
the
words
ofzenock
and
to
be
crucified
according
to
the
words
of
neum
andto
be
buried
in
a
sepulchre
according
to
the
words
of
zenoswhich
he
spake
concerning
the
three
days
of
darkness
whichshould
be
a
sign
given
of
his
death
unto
those
who
should
inhabitthe
isles
of
the
sea
more
especially
given
unto
those
who
are
ofthe
house
of
Israel
nephi


for
thus
spake
the
prophet
the
lord
god
surely
shall
visitall
the
house
of
Israel
at
that
day
some
with
his
voice
becauseof
their
righteousness
unto
their
great
joy
and
salvation
andothers
with
the
thunderings
and
the
lightnings
of
his
power
bytempest
by
fire
and
by
smoke
and
vapor
of
darkness
and
by
theopening
of
the
earth
and
by
mountains
which
shall
be
carried
up
nephi


and
all
these
things
must
surely
come
saith
the
prophetzenos

and
the
rocks
of
the
earth
must
rend
and
because
of
thegroanings
of
the
earth
many
of
the
kings
of
the
isles
of
the
seashall
be
wrought
upon
by
the
spirit
of
god
to
exclaim
the
godof
nature
suffers
nephi


and
as
for
those
who
are
at
jerusalem
saith
the
prophetthey
shall
be
scourged
by
all
people
because
they
crucify
thegod
of
Israel
and
turn
their
hearts
aside
rejecting
signs
andwonders
and
the
power
and
glory
of
the
god
of
Israel
nephi


and
because
they
turn
their
hearts
aside
saith
the
prophetand
have
despised
the
holy
one
of
Israel
they
shall
wander
inthe
flesh
and
perish
and
become
a
hiss
and
a
byword
and
behated
among
all
nations
nephi


nevertheless
when
that
day
cometh
saith
the
prophet
thatthey
no
more
turn
aside
their
hearts
against
the
holy
one
ofIsrael
then
will
he
remember
the
covenants
which
he
made
totheir
fathers
nephi


yea
then
will
he
remember
the
isles
of
the
sea
yea
and
allthe
people
who
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
will
I
gather
insaith
the
lord
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophet
zenos
fromthe
four
quarters
of
the
earth
nephi


yea
and
all
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
the
lordsaith
the
prophet
every
nation
kindred
tongue
and
people
shallbe
blessed
nephi


and
I
nephi
have
written
these
things
unto
my
people
thatperhaps
I
might
persuade
them
that
they
would
remember
the
lordtheir
redeemer
nephi


wherefore
I
speak
unto
all
the
house
of
Israel
if
it
so
bethat
they
should
obtain
these
things
nephi


for
behold
I
have
workings
in
the
spirit
which
doth
wearyme
even
that
all
my
joints
are
weak
for
those
who
are
atjerusalem
for
had
not
the
lord
been
merciful
to
show
unto
meconcerning
them
even
as
he
had
prophets
of
old
I
should
haveperished
also
nephi


and
he
surely
did
show
unto
the
prophets
of
old
all
thingsconcerning
them
and
also
he
did
show
unto
many
concerning
uswherefore
it
must
needs
be
that
we
know
concerning
them
for
theyare
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass
nephi


now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
teach
my
brethrenthese
things
and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
read
many
things
tothem
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
that
theymight
know
concerning
the
doings
of
the
lord
in
other
landsamong
people
of
old
nephi


and
I
did
read
many
things
unto
them
which
were
written
inthe
books
of
moses
but
that
I
might
more
fully
persuade
them
tobelieve
in
the
lord
their
redeemer
I
did
read
unto
them
thatwhich
was
written
by
the
prophet
Isaiah
for
I
did
liken
allscriptures
unto
us
that
it
might
be
for
our
profit
and
learning
nephi


wherefore
I
spake
unto
them
saying
hear
ye
the
words
of
theprophet
ye
who
are
a
remnant
of
the
house
of
Israel
a
branchwho
have
been
broken
off
hear
ye
the
words
of
the
prophet
whichwere
written
unto
all
the
house
of
Israel
and
liken
them
untoyourselves
that
ye
may
have
hope
as
well
as
your
brethren
fromwhom
ye
have
been
broken
off
for
after
this
manner

chapter

nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
nephi
had
read
thesethings
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
my
brethrencame
unto
me
and
said
unto
me
what
meaneth
these
things
which
yehave
read

behold
are
they
to
be
understood
according
to
thingswhich
are
spiritual
which
shall
come
to
pass
according
to
thespirit
and
not
the
flesh
nephi


and
I
nephi
said
unto
them
behold
they
were
manifest
untothe
prophet
by
the
voice
of
the
spirit
for
by
the
spirit
are
allthings
made
known
unto
the
prophets
which
shall
come
upon
thechildren
of
men
according
to
the
flesh
nephi


wherefore
the
things
of
which
I
have
read
are
thingspertaining
to
things
both
temporal
and
spiritual
for
it
appearsthat
the
house
of
Israel
sooner
or
later
will
be
scattered
uponall
the
face
of
the
earth
and
also
among
all
nations
nephi


and
behold
there
are
many
who
are
already
lost
from
theknowledge
of
those
who
are
at
jerusalem

yea
the
more
part
ofall
the
tribes
have
been
led
away
and
they
are
scattered
to
andfro
upon
the
isles
of
the

whither
they
are
none
of
usknoweth
save
that
we
know
that
they
have
been
led
away
nephi


and
since
they
have
been
led
away
these
things
have
beenprophesied
concerning
them
and
also
concerning
all
those
whoshall
hereafter
be
scattered
and
be
confounded
because
of
theholy
one
of
Israel
for
against
him
will
they
harden
theirhearts
wherefore
they
shall
be
scattered
among
all
nations
andshall
be
hated
of
all
men
nephi


nevertheless
after
they
shall
be
nursed
by
the
gentiles
andthe
lord
has
lifted
up
his
hand
upon
the
gentiles
and
set
them
upfor
a
standard
and
their
children
have
been
carried
in
theirarms
and
their
daughters
have
been
carried
upon
their
shouldersbehold
these
things
of
which
are
spoken
are
temporal
for
thusare
the
covenants
of
the
lord
with
our
fathers
and
it
meaneth
usin
the
days
to
come
and
also
all
our
brethren
who
are
of
thehouse
of
Israel
nephi


and
it
meaneth
that
the
time
cometh
that
after
all
the
houseof
Israel
have
been
scattered
and
confounded
that
the
lord
godwill
raise
up
a
mighty
nation
among
the
gentiles
yea
even
uponthe
face
of
this
land
and
by
them
shall
our
seed
be
scattered
nephi


and
after
our
seed
is
scattered
the
lord
god
will
proceed
todo
a
marvelous
work
among
the
gentiles
which
shall
be
of
greatworth
unto
our
seed
wherefore
it
is
likened
unto
their
beingnourished
by
the
gentiles
and
being
carried
in
their
arms
andupon
their
shoulders
nephi


and
it
shall
also
be
of
worth
unto
the
gentiles
and
not
onlyunto
the
gentiles
but
unto
all
the
house
of
Israel
unto
themaking
known

In

I
would
my

that

of
the
earth
cannot
be
blessed
unless
he
shall
make
barehis

wherefore
the

will
proceed
to
make
bare
his

of
all
the

in
bringing
about
his
covenants

unto
those

wherefore
he
will
bring
them
again
out

they
shall
be
brought

and
the

notsuffer
that
the
wicked
shall
destroy
the
righteous
nephi


wherefore
he
will
preserve
the
righteous
by
his
power
evenif
it
so
be
that
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
must
come
and
therighteous
be
preserved
even
unto
the
destruction
of

by

wherefore
the
righteous
need
not
fear
forthus
saith
the
prophet
they
shall
be
saved
even
if
it
so
be
asby

nephi


behold
my
brethren
I
say
unto
you
that
these
things
mustshortly
come
yea
even
blood
and
fire
and
vapor
of
smoke
mustcome
and
it
must
needs
be
upon
the
face
of
this
earth
and
itcometh
unto
men
according
to
the
flesh
if
it
so
be
that
they
willharden
their
hearts
against
the
holy
one
of
Israel
nephi


for
behold
the
righteous
shall
not
perish
for
the
timesurely
must
come
that
all
they
who
fight
against
zion
shall
becut
off
nephi


and
the
lord
will
surely
prepare
a
way
for
his
people
untothe
fulfilling
of
the
words
of
moses
which
he
spake
saying
aprophet
shall
the
lord
your
god
raise
up
unto
you
like
unto
mehim
shall
ye
hear
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
youand
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
all
those
who
will
not
hear
thatprophet
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
the
people
nephi


and
now
I
nephi
declare
unto
you
that
this
prophet
of
whommoses
spake
was
the
holy
one
of
Israel
wherefore
he
shallexecute
judgment
in
righteousness
nephi


and
the
righteous
need
not
fear
for
they
are
those
who
shallnot
be
confounded

but
it
is
the
kingdom
of
the
devil
whichshall
be
built
up
among
the
children
of
men
which
kingdom
isestablished
among
them
which
are
in
the
flesh
nephi


for
the
time
speedily
shall
come
that
all
churches
which
arebuilt
up
to
get
gain
and
all
those
who
are
built
up
to
get
powerover
the
flesh
and
those
who
are
built
up
to
become
popular
inthe
eyes
of
the
world
and
those
who
seek
the
lusts
of
the
fleshand
the
things
of
the
world
and
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquityyea
in
fine
all
those
who
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
the
devilare
they
who
need
fear
and
tremble
and
quake
they
are
thosewho
must
be
brought
low
in
the
dust
they
are
those
who
must
beconsumed
as
stubble
and
this
is
according
to
the
words
of
theprophet
nephi


and
the
time
cometh
speedily
that
the
righteous
must
be
ledup
as
calves
of
the
stall
and
the
holy
one
of
Israel
must
reignin
dominion
and
might
and
power
and
great
glory
nephi


and
he
gathereth
his
children
from
the
four
quarters
of
theearth
and
he
numbereth
his
sheep
and
they
know
him
and
thereshall
be
one
fold
and
one
shepherd
and
he
shall
feed
his
sheepand
in
him
they
shall
find
pasture
nephi


and
because
of
the
righteousness
of
his
people
satan
has
nopower
wherefore
he
cannot
be
loosed
for
the
space
of
manyyears
for
he
hath
no
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
people
forthey
dwell
in
righteousness
and
the
holy
one
of
Israel
reigneth
nephi


and
now
behold
I
nephi
say
unto
you
that
all
these
thingsmust
come
according
to
the
flesh
nephi


but
behold
all
nations
kindreds
tongues
and
people
shalldwell
safely
in
the
holy
one
of
Israel
if
it
so
be
that
they
willrepent
nephi


and
now
I
nephi
make
an
end
for
I
durst
not
speak
furtheras
yet
concerning
these
things
nephi


wherefore
my
brethren
I
would
that
ye
should
consider
thatthe
things
which
have
been
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass
aretrue
and
they
testify
that
a
man
must
be
obedient
to
thecommandments
of

nephi


wherefore
ye
need
not
suppose
that
I
and
my
father
are
theonly
ones
that
have
testified
and
also
taught
them

whereforeif
ye
shall
be
obedient
to
the

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
nephi
had
made
an
endof
teaching
my
brethren
our
father
lehi
also
spake
many
thingsunto
them
and
rehearsed
unto
them
how
great
things
the
lord
haddone
for
them
in
bringing
them
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
nephi


and
he
spake
unto
them
concerning
their
rebellions
upon
thewaters
and
the
mercies
of
god
in
sparing
their
lives
that
theywere
not
swallowed
up
in
the
sea
nephi


and
he
also
spake
unto
them
concerning
the
land
of
promisewhich
they
had
obtainedhow
merciful
the
lord
had
been
inwarning
us
that
we
should
flee
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
nephi


for
behold
said
he
I
have
seen
a
vision
in
which
I
knowthat
jerusalem
is
destroyed
and
had
we
remained
in
jerusalem
weshould
also
have
perished
nephi


but
said
he
notwithstanding
our
afflictions
we
haveobtained
a
land
of
promise
a
land
which
is
choice
above
allother
lands
a
land
which
the
lord
god
hath
covenanted
with
meshould
be
a
land
for
the
inheritance
of
my
seed

yea
the
lordhath
covenanted
this
land
unto
me
and
to
my
children
foreverand
also
all
those
who
should
be
led
out
of
other
countries
bythe
hand
of
the
lord
nephi


wherefore
I
lehi
prophesy
according
to
the
workings
of
thespirit
which
is
in
me
that
there
shall
none
come
into
this
landsave
they
shall
be
brought
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
nephi


wherefore
this
land
is
consecrated
unto
him
whom
he
shallbring

and
if
it
so
be
that
they
shall
serve
him
according
tothe
commandments
which
he
hath
given
it
shall
be
a
land
ofliberty
unto
them
wherefore
they
shall
never
be
brought
downinto
captivity
if
so
it
shall
be
because
of
iniquity
for
ifiniquity
shall
abound
cursed
shall
be
the
land
for
their
sakesbut
unto
the
righteous
it
shall
be
blessed
forever
nephi


and
behold
it
is
wisdom
that
this
land
should
be
kept
as
yetfrom
the
knowledge
of
other
nations
for
behold
many
nationswould
overrun
the
land
that
there
would
be
no
place
for
aninheritance
nephi


wherefore
I
lehi
have
obtained
a
promise
that
inasmuch
asthose
whom
the
lord
god
shall
bring
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalemshall
keep
his
commandments
they
shall
prosper
upon
the
face
ofthis
land
and
they
shall
be
kept
from
all
other
nations
thatthey
may
possess
this
land
unto
themselves

and
if
it
so
be
thatthey
shall
keep
his
commandments
they
shall
be
blessed
upon
theface
of
this
land
and
there
shall
be
none
to
molest
them
nor
totake
away
the
land
of
their
inheritance
and
they
shall
dwellsafely
forever
nephi


but
behold
when
the
time
cometh
that
they
shall
dwindle
inunbelief
after
they
have
received
so
great
blessings
from
thehand
of
the
lordhaving
a
knowledge
of
the
creation
of
theearth
and
all
men
knowing
the
great
and
marvelous
works
of
thelord
from
the
creation
of
the
world
having
power
given
them
todo
all
things
by
faith
having
all
the
commandments
from
thebeginning
and
having
been
brought
by
his
infinite
goodness
intothis
precious
land
of
promisebehold
I
say
if
the
day
shallcome
that
they
will
reject
the
holy
one
of
Israel
the
truemessiah
their
redeemer
and
their
god
behold
the
judgments
ofhim
that
is
just
shall
rest
upon
them
nephi


yea
he
will
bring
other
nations
unto
them
and
he
will
giveunto
them
power
and
he
will
take
away
from
them
the
lands
oftheir
possessions
and
he
will
cause
them
to
be
scattered
andsmitten
nephi


yea
as
one
generation
passeth
to

there
shall
bebloodsheds

awake

and
arise
from

and
hear
the
words
of

whose
limbs
ye
must
soon
lay
down
in

from
whence
no

I
go

behold
the

redeemed
my
soul
from

I
havebeheld
his
glory
and
I
am
encircled
about
eternally
in
the
armsof
his

and
I
desire
that
ye
should
remember
to
observe
the
statutesand
the
judgments
of
the
lord
behold
this
hath
been
the
anxietyof
my
soul
from
the
beginning
nephi


my
heart
hath
been
weighed
down
with
sorrow
from
time
totime
for
I
have
feared
lest
for
the
hardness
of
your

thelord
your
god
should
come
out
in
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
uponyou
that
ye

or
that
a

should
come
upon

for
the

of

and
ye
are
visited
by

and
by

rebel
no
more
against
your
brother
whose
views
have
beenglorious
and
who
hath
kept
the
commandments
from
the
time
thatwe
left
jerusalem
and
who
hath
been
an
instrument
in
the
handsof
god
in
bringing
us
forth
into
the
land
of
promise
for
wereit
not
for
him
we
must
have
perished
with
hunger
in
thewilderness
nevertheless
ye
sought
to
take
away
his
life
yeaand
he
hath
suffered
much
sorrow
because
of
you
nephi


and
I
exceedingly
fear
and
tremble
because
of
you
lest
heshall
suffer
again
for
behold
ye
have
accused
him
that
hesought
power
and
authority
over
you
but
I
know
that
he
hath
notsought
for
power
nor
authority
over
you
but
he
hath
sought
theglory
of
god
and
your
own
eternal
welfare
nephi


and
ye
have
murmured
because
he
hath
been
plain
unto
you

yesay
that
he
hath
used
sharpness
ye
say
that
he
hath
been
angrywith
you
but
behold
his
sharpness
was
the
sharpness
of
thepower
of
the
word
of
god
which
was
in
him
and
that
which
yecall
anger
was
the
truth
according
to
that
which
is
in
godwhich
he
could
not
restrain
manifesting
boldly
concerning
youriniquities
nephi


and
it
must
needs
be
that
the
power
of
god
must
be
with
himeven
unto
his
commanding
you
that
ye
must
obey

but
behold
itwas
not
he
but
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
lord
which
was
in
himwhich
opened
his
mouth
to
utterance
that
he
could
not
shut
it
nephi


and
now
my
son
laman
and
also
lemuel
and
sam
and
also
mysons
who
are
the
sons
of
Ishmael
behold
if
ye
will
hearken
untothe
voice
of
nephi
ye
shall
not
perish

and
if
ye
will
hearkenunto
him
I
leave
unto
you
a
blessing
yea
even
my
firstblessing
nephi


but
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
him
I
take
away
my
firstblessing
yea
even
my

and
it
shall
rest
upon
him
nephi


and
now
zoram
I
speak
unto

behold
thou

and
now
jacob
I
speak
unto
you
thou
art
my
firstborn
inthe
days
of
my
tribulation
in
the
wilderness

and
behold
in
thychildhood
thou
hast
suffered
afflictions
and
much
sorrow
becauseof
the
rudeness
of
thy
brethren
nephi


nevertheless
jacob
my
firstborn
in

thouknowest
the
greatness
of

and
he
shall
consecrate
thineafflictions
for
thy

wherefore
thy

shall
be
blessed
and
thou
shalt
dwellsafely
with
thy
brother
nephi
and
thy
days
shall
be
spent
inthe
service
of
thy

wherefore
I
know
that
thou
artredeemed
because
of
the
righteousness
of
thy
redeemer
for
thouhast
beheld
that
in
the
fulness

he
cometh
to

and
thou
hast
beheld
in

youth
his
glory
wherefore
thouart
blessed
even
as
they
unto
whom
he
shall
minister
in
theflesh
for
the
spirit
is
the
same
yesterday
today
and
foreverand
the
way
is
prepared
from
the
fall
of
man
and
salvation
isfree
nephi


and
men
are
instructed
sufficiently
that
they
know
good
fromevil

and
the
law
is
given
unto
men

and
by
the
law
no
flesh
isjustified
or
by
the
law
men
are
cut
off

yea
by
the
temporallaw
they
were
cut
off
and
also
by
the
spiritual
law
they
perishfrom
that
which
is
good
and
become
miserable
forever
nephi


wherefore
redemption
cometh
in
and
through
the
holy
messiahfor
he
is
full
of
grace
and
truth
nephi


behold
he
offereth
himself
a
sacrifice
for
sin
to
answer
theends
of
the
law
unto
all
those
who
have
a
broken
heart
and
acontrite
spirit
and
unto
none
else
can
the
ends
of
the
law
beanswered
nephi


wherefore
how
great
the
importance
to
make
these
things
knownunto
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
that
they
may
know
that
thereis
no
flesh
that
can
dwell
in
the
presence
of

save
it
bethrough
the
merits
and
mercy
and
grace
of
the
holy
messiah
wholayeth
down
his
life
according
to
the
flesh
and
taketh
it
againby
the
power
of
the
spirit
that
he
may
bring
to
pass
theresurrection
of
the
dead
being
the
first
that
should
rise
nephi


wherefore
he
is
the
firstfruits
unto
god
inasmuch
as
heshall
make
intercession
for
all
the
children
of
men
and
theythat
believe
in
him
shall
be
saved
nephi


and
because
of
the
intercession
for
all
all
men
come
untogod
wherefore
they
stand
in
the
presence
of
him
to
be
judged
ofhim
according
to
the
truth
and
holiness
which
is
in
him
wherefore
the
ends
of
the
law
which
the
holy
one
hath
givenunto
the
inflicting
of
the
punishment
which
is
affixed
whichpunishment
that
is

is
in
opposition
to
that
of

for
it
must

be
that
there
is
an
opposition
in
allthings

If
not
so
my
firstborn
in
the
wildernessrighteousness
could
not
be
brought
to
pass
neither
wickednessneither
holiness
nor
misery
neither
good
nor
bad

whereforeall
things
must
needs
be
a
compound
in
one
wherefore
if
itshould
be
one
body
it
must
needs
remain
as
dead
having
no
lifeneither
death
nor
corruption
nor
incorruption
happiness
normisery
neither
sense
nor
insensibility
nephi


wherefore
it
must
needs
have
been
created
for
a
thing
ofnaught
wherefore
there
would
have
been
no
purpose
in
the
end
ofits
creation

wherefore
this
thing
must
needs
destroy
thewisdom
of
god
and
his
eternal
purposes
and
also
the
power
andthe
mercy
and
the
justice
of
god
nephi


and
if
ye
shall
say
there
is
no
law
ye
shall
also
say
thereis
no
sin

If
ye
shall
say
there
is
no
sin
ye
shall
also
saythere
is
no
righteousness

and
if
there
be
no
righteousnessthere
be
no
happiness

and
if
there
be
no
righteousness
norhappiness
there
be
no
punishment
nor
misery

and
if
these
thingsare
not
there
is
no
god

and
if
there
is
no
god
we
are
notneither
the
earth
for
there
could
have
been
no
creation
ofthings
neither
to
act
nor
to
be
acted
upon
wherefore
allthings
must
have
vanished
away
nephi


and
now
my
sons
I
speak
unto
you
these
things
for
yourprofit
and
learning
for
there
is
a
god
and
he
hath
created
allthings
both
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
all
things
that
inthem
are
both
things
to
act
and
things
to
be
acted
upon
nephi


and
to
bring
about
his
eternal
purposes
in
the
end
of
manafter
he
had
created
our
first
parents
and
the
beasts
of
thefield
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
in
fine
all
things
which
arecreated
it
must
needs
be
that
there
was
an
opposition
even
theforbidden
fruit
in
opposition
to
the
tree
of
life
the
one
beingsweet
and
the
other
bitter
nephi


wherefore
the
lord
god
gave
unto
man
that
he
should
act
forhimself

wherefore
man
could
not
act
for
himself
save
it
shouldbe
that
he
was
enticed
by
the
one
or
the
other
nephi


and
I
lehi
according
to
the
things
which
I
have
read
mustneeds
suppose
that
an
angel
of
god
according
to
that
which
iswritten
had
fallen
from
heaven
wherefore
he
became
a
devilhaving
sought
that
which
was
evil
before
god
nephi


and
because
he
had
fallen
from
heaven
and
had
becomemiserable
forever
he
sought
also
the
misery
of
all
mankind
wherefore
he
said
unto
eve
yea
even
that
old
serpent
who
isthe
devil
who
is
the
father
of
all
lies
wherefore
he
saidpartake
of
the
forbidden
fruit
and
ye
shall
not
die
but
yeshall
be
as
god
knowing
good
and
evil
nephi


and
after
adam
and
eve
had
partaken
of
the
forbidden
fruitthey
were
driven
out
of
the
garden
of
eden
to
till
the
earth
nephi


and
they
have
brought
forth
children
yea
even
the
family
ofall
the
earth
nephi


and
the
days
of
the
children
of
men
were
prolonged
accordingto
the
will
of
god
that
they
might
repent
while
in
the
fleshwherefore
their
state
became
a
state
of
probation
and
theirtime
was
lengthened
according
to
the
commandments
which
the
lordgod
gave
unto
the
children
of
men

for
he
gave
commandment
thatall
men
must
repent
for
he
showed
unto
all
men
that
they
werelost
because
of
the
transgression
of
their
parents
nephi


and
now
behold
if
adam
had
not
transgressed
he
would
nothave
fallen
but
he
would
have
remained
in
the
garden
of
eden
and
all
things
which
were
created
must
have
remained
in
the
samestate
in
which
they
were
after
they
were
created
and
they
musthave
remained
forever
and
had
no
end
nephi


and
they
would
have
had
no
children
wherefore
they
wouldhave
remained
in
a
state
of
innocence
having
no
joy
for
theyknew
no
misery
doing
no
good
for
they
knew
no
sin
nephi


but
behold
all
things
have
been
done
in
the
wisdom
of
himwho
knoweth
all
things
nephi


adam
fell
that
men
might
be
and
men
are
that
they
mighthave
joy
nephi


and
the
messiah
cometh
in
the
fulness
of
time
that
he
mayredeem
the
children
of
men
from
the
fall

and
because
that
theyare
redeemed
from
the
fall
they
have
become
free
forever
knowinggood
from
evil
to
act
for
themselves
and
not
to
be
acted
uponsave
it
be
by
the
punishment
of
the
law
at
the
great
and
lastday
according
to
the
commandments
which
god
hath
given
nephi


wherefore
men
are
free
according
to
the
flesh
and
allthings
are
given
them
which
are
expedient
unto
man

and
they
arefree
to
choose
liberty
and
eternal
life
through
the
greatmediator
of
all
men
or
to
choose
captivity
and
death
accordingto
the
captivity
and
power
of
the
devil
for
he
seeketh
that
allmen
might
be
miserable
like
unto
himself
nephi


and
now
my
sons
I
would
that
ye
should
look
to
the
greatmediator
and
hearken
unto
his
great
commandments
and
befaithful
unto
his
words
and
choose
eternal
life
according
tothe
will
of
his
holy
spirit
nephi


and
not
choose
eternal
death
according
to
the
will
of
theflesh
and
the
evil
which
is
therein
which
giveth
the
spirit
ofthe
devil
power
to
captivate
to
bring
you
down
to
hell
that
hemay
reign
over
you
in
his
own
kingdom
nephi


I
have
spoken
these
few
words
unto
you
all
my
sons
in
thelast
days
of
my
probation
and
I
have
chosen
the
good
partaccording
to

I
have
none

save
it
be

of
joseph
who
was
carried
captive
into

andgreat
were
the
covenants
of

which
he
made
unto

wherefore
joseph
truly
saw
our
day

and
he
obtained
apromise
of
the
lord
that
out
of
the
fruit
of
his
loins
the
lordgod
would
raise
up
a
righteous
branch
unto
the
house
of

the

a
branch
which
was
to
be
broken
offnevertheless
to
be
remembered
in
the
covenants
of
the

thatthe
messiah
should
be
made
manifest
unto

unto
the
bringing
of
them
out
of
darknessunto
lightyea
out
of
hidden
darkness
and
out

for
joseph
truly
testified
saying
a
seer
shall
the
lord
mygod
raise
up
who
shall
be
a
choice
seer
unto
the
fruit
of

yea
joseph
truly
said
thus
saith
the

unto

a

I
raise
up
out
of

and
he
shallbe
esteemed
highly
among

and
unto
himwill
I
give
commandment
that
he
shall
do
a

for
the
fruit
ofthy

which
shall
be
of
great

unto

to
the
bringing
of
them
to
the
knowledge
of
the

I
have
made
with
thy

nephi


and
I
will
give
unto
him
a
commandment
that
he
shall
do
noneother
work
save
the
work
which
I
shall
command
him

and
I
willmake
him
great
in
mine
eyes
for
he
shall
do
my
work
nephi


and
he
shall
be
great
like
unto
moses

I
have
said
Iwould
raise
up
unto

to
deliver
my
people
o

of
Israel
nephi


and
moses
will
I
raise
up
to
deliver
thy

out

but
a

will
I
raise
up
out
of

andunto
him
will
I
give
power
to
bring
forth
my
word
unto
the
seedof
thy

not
to
the
bringing
forth
my
word
only
saiththe

but
to
the
convincing
them
of
my

havealready
gone
forth
among

nephi


wherefore
the
fruit
of
thy

shall
write
and
the
fruitof
the
loins
of

shall
write
and
that
which
shall
bewritten
by
the
fruit
of

and
also
that
which
shall
bewritten
by
the
fruit
of
the
loins
of
judah
shall
grow
togetherunto
the
confounding
of
false
doctrines
and
laying
down
ofcontentions
and
establishing
peace
among
the
fruit
of
thy
loinsand
bringing
them
to
the
knowledge
of
their
fathers
in
the
latterdays
and
also
to
the
knowledge
of
my

and
out
of

day
whenmy

shall
commence
among
all
my
people
unto
the
restoringthee
o

saith
the
lord

and
thus
prophesied
joseph
saying
behold
that

and
they
that
seek
to
destroy
him
shall
beconfounded
for
this
promise
which
I
have
obtained
of
the
lordof

fruit
of
my
loins
shall
be
fulfilled

behold
I
am
sureof
the
fulfilling
of
this
promise
nephi


and
his
name
shall
be
called
after
me
and
it
shall
be
afterthe
name
of
his
father

and
he
shall
be
like
unto
me
for
thething
which
the
lord
shall
bring
forth
by
his
hand
by
the
powerof
the
lord
shall
bring
my
people
unto
salvation
nephi


yea
thus
prophesied
joseph
I
am
sure
of
this
thing
even
asI
am
sure
of
the
promise
of
moses
for
the
lord
hath
said
untome
I
will
preserve
thy
seed
forever
nephi


and
the
lord
hath
said
I
will
raise
up
a
moses
and
I
willgive
power
unto
him
in
a
rod
and
I
will
give
judgment
unto
himin
writing

yet
I
will
not
loose
his
tongue
that
he
shall
speakmuch
for
I
will
not
make
him
mighty
in
speaking

but
I
willwrite
unto
him
my
law
by
the
finger
of
mine
own
hand
and
I
willmake
a
spokesman
for
him
nephi


and
the
lord
said
unto
me
also
I
will
raise
up
unto
thefruit
of
thy
loins
and
I
will
make
for
him
a
spokesman

and
Ibehold
I
will
give
unto
him
that
he
shall
write
the
writing
ofthe
fruit
of
thy
loins
unto
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
and
thespokesman
of
thy
loins
shall
declare
it
nephi


and
the
words
which
he
shall
write
shall
be
the
words
whichare
expedient
in
my
wisdom
should
go
forth
unto
the
fruit
of
thyloins

and
it
shall
be
as
if
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
had
criedunto
them
from
the
dust
for
I
know
their
faith
nephi


and
they
shall
cry
from
the
dust
yea
even
repentance
untotheir
brethren
even
after
many
generations
have
gone
by
them
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
their
cry
shall
go
even
accordingto
the
simpleness
of
their
words
nephi


because
of
their
faith
their
words
shall
proceed
forth
out
ofmy
mouth
unto
their
brethren
who
are
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
andthe
weakness
of
their
words
will
I
make
strong
in
their
faithunto
the
remembering
of
my
covenant
which
I
made
unto
thyfathers
nephi


and
now
behold
my
son
joseph
after
this
manner
did
myfather
of
old
prophesy
nephi


wherefore
because
of
this
covenant
thou
art
blessed
for
thyseed

not
be
destroyed
for
they
shall
hearken
unto
thewords
of
the
book

and
there
shall
rise
up
one
mighty
among
them
who
shall
domuch
good

in
word
and
in

an
instrument
in

with
exceeding
faith

work
mighty
wonders
anddo
that

chapter

nephi


and
now
I
nephi
speak
concerning
the
prophecies
of
which
myfather
hath
spoken
concerning
joseph
who
was
carried
intoegypt
nephi


for
behold
he
truly
prophesied
concerning
all
his
seed

andthe
prophecies
which
he
wrote
there
are
not
many
greater

andhe
prophesied
concerning
us
and
our
future
generations
and
theyare
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass
nephi


wherefore
after
my
father
had
made
an
end
of
speakingconcerning
the
prophecies
of
joseph
he
called
the
children
oflaman
his
sons
and
his
daughters
and
said
unto
them
beholdmy
sons
and
my
daughters
who
are
the
sons
and
the
daughters
ofmy
firstborn
I
would
that
ye
should
give
ear
unto
my
words
nephi


for
the
lord
god
hath
said
that
Inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
mycommandments
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
and
inasmuch
as
yewill
not
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
mypresence
nephi


but
behold
my
sons
and
my
daughters
I
cannot
go
down
to
mygrave
save
I
should
leave
a
blessing
upon
you
for
behold
I
knowthat
if
ye
are
brought
up
in
the
way
ye
should
go
ye
will
notdepart
from
it
nephi


wherefore
if
ye
are
cursed
behold
I
leave
my
blessing
uponyou
that
the
cursing
may
be
taken
from
you
and
be
answered
uponthe
heads
of
your
parents
nephi


wherefore
because
of
my
blessing
the
lord
god
will
not
sufferthat
ye
shall
perish
wherefore
he
will
be
merciful
unto
you
andunto
your
seed
forever
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
my
father
had
made
an
end
ofspeaking
to
the
sons
and
daughters
of
laman
he
caused
the
sonsand
daughters
of
lemuel
to
be
brought
before
him
nephi


and
he
spake
unto
them
saying
behold
my
sons
and
mydaughters
who
are
the
sons
and
the
daughters
of
my
second
sonbehold
I
leave
unto
you
the
same
blessing
which
I
left
unto
thesons
and
daughters
of
laman
wherefore
thou
shalt
not
utterly
bedestroyed
but
in
the
end
thy
seed
shall
be
blessed
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
made
an
end
ofspeaking
unto
them
behold
he
spake
unto
the
sons
of
Ishmaelyea
and
even
all
his
household
nephi


and
after
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
them
he
spakeunto
sam
saying
blessed
art
thou
and
thy
seed
for
thou
shallinherit
the
land
like
unto
thy
brother
nephi

and
thy
seed
shallbe
numbered
with
his
seed
and
thou
shalt
be
even
like
unto
thybrother
and
thy
seed
like
unto
his
seed
and
thou
shalt
beblessed
in
all
thy
days
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
lehi
had
spoken
untoall
his
household
according
to
the
feelings
of
his
heart
and
thespirit
of
the
lord
which
was
in
him
he
waxed
old

and
it
cameto
pass
that
he
died
and
was
buried
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
not
many
days
after
his
death
lamanand
lemuel
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
were
angry
with
me
because
ofthe
admonitions
of
the
lord
nephi


for
I
nephi
was
constrained
to
speak
unto
them
accordingto
his
word
for
I
had
spoken
many
things
unto
them
and
also
myfather
before
his
death
many
of
which
sayings
are
written
uponmine
other

for

and
upon
these
I

many
of

chapter

nephi


behold
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
cry
much
unto
thelord
my
god
because
of
the
anger
of
my
brethren
nephi


but
behold
their
anger
did
increase
against
me
insomuch
thatthey
did
seek
to
take
away
my
life
nephi


yea
they
did
murmur
against
me
saying
our
younger
brotherthinks
to
rule
over
us
and
we
have
had
much
trial
because
ofhim
wherefore
now
let
us
slay
him
that
we
may
not
be
afflictedmore
because
of
his
words

for
behold
we
will
not
have
him
tobe
our
ruler
for
it
belongs
unto
us
who
are
the
elder
brethrento
rule
over
this
people
nephi


now
I
do
not
write
upon
these
plates
all
the
words
which
theymurmured
against
me

but
it
sufficeth
me
to
say
that
they
didseek
to
take
away
my
life
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
warn
me
that
I
nephishould
depart
from
them
and
flee
into
the
wilderness
and
allthose
who
would
go
with
me
nephi


wherefore
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
take
my
familyand
also
zoram
and
his
family
and
sam
mine
elder
brother
andhis
family
and
jacob
and
joseph
my
younger
brethren
and
alsomy
sisters
and
all
those
who
would
go
with
me

and
all
thosewho
would
go
with
me
were
those
who
believed
in
the
warnings
andthe
revelations
of
god
wherefore
they
did
hearken
unto
mywords
nephi


and
we
did
take
our
tents
and
whatsoever
things
were
possiblefor
us
and
did
journey
in
the
wilderness
for
the
space
of
manydays

and
after
we
had
journeyed
for
the
space
of
many
days
wedid
pitch
our
tents
nephi


and
my
people
would
that
we
should
call
the
name
of
the
placenephi
wherefore
we
did
call
it
nephi
nephi


and
all
those
who
were
with
me
did
take
upon
them
to
callthemselves
the
people
of
nephi
nephi


and
we
did
observe
to
keep
the
judgments
and
the
statutesand
the
commandments
of
the
lord
in
all
things
according
to
thelaw
of
moses
nephi


and
the
lord
was
with
us
and
we
did
prosper
exceedingly
forwe
did
sow
seed
and
we
did
reap
again
in
abundance

and
webegan
to
raise
flocks
and
herds
and
animals
of
every
kind
nephi


and
I
nephi
had
also
brought
the
records
which
wereengraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
and
also
the
ball
or
compasswhich
was
prepared
for
my
father
by
the
hand
of
the
lordaccording
to
that
which
is
written
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
began
to
prosper
exceedingly
andto
multiply
in
the
land
nephi


and
I
nephi
did
take
the
sword
of
laban
and
after
themanner
of
it
did
make
many
swords
lest
by
any
means
the
peoplewho
were
now
called
lamanites
should
come
upon
us
and
destroy
usfor
I
knew
their
hatred
towards
me
and
my
children
and
those
whowere
called
my
people
nephi


and
I
did
teach
my
people
to
build
buildings
and
to
work
inall
manner
of
wood
and
of
iron
and
of
copper
and
of
brass
andof
steel
and
of
gold
and
of
silver
and
of
precious
ores
whichwere
in
great
abundance
nephi


and
I
nephi
did
build
a
temple
and
I
did
construct
itafter
the
manner
of
the
temple
of
solomon
save
it
were
not
builtof
so
many
precious
things
for
they
were
not
to
be
found
uponthe
land
wherefore
it
could
not
be
built
like
unto
solomonstemple

but
the
manner
of
the
construction
was
like
unto
thetemple
of
solomon
and
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceedinglyfine
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
cause
my
people
to
beindustrious
and
to
labor
with
their
hands
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
would
that
I
should
be
theirking

but
I
nephi
was
desirous
that
they
should
have
no
kingnevertheless
I
did
for
them
according
to
that
which
was
in
mypower
nephi


and
behold
the
words
of
the
lord
had
been
fulfilled
unto
mybrethren
which
he
spake
concerning
them
that
I
should
be
theirruler
and
their
teacher

wherefore
I
had
been
their
ruler
andtheir
teacher
according
to
the
commandments
of
the
lord
untilthe
time
they
sought
to
take
away
my
life
nephi


wherefore
the
word
of
the
lord
was
fulfilled
which
he
spakeunto
me
saying
that
Inasmuch
as
they
will
not
hearken
unto
thywords
they
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord

andbehold
they
were
cut
off
from
his
presence
nephi


and
he
had
caused
the
cursing
to
come
upon
them
yea
even
asore
cursing
because
of
their
iniquity

for
behold
they
hadhardened
their
hearts
against
him
that
they
had
become
like
untoa
flint
wherefore
as
they
were
white
and
exceedingly
fair
anddelightsome
that
they
might
not
be
enticing
unto
my
people
thelord
god
did
cause
a
skin
of
blackness
to
come
upon
them
nephi


and
thus
saith
the
lord
god
I
will
cause
that
they
shall
beloathsome
unto
thy
people
save
they
shall
repent
of
theiriniquities
nephi


and
cursed
shall
be
the
seed
of
him
that
mixeth
with
theirseed
for
they
shall
be
cursed
even
with
the
same
cursing

andthe
lord
spake
it
and
it
was
done
nephi


and
because
of
their
cursing
which
was
upon
them
they
didbecome
an
idle
people
full
of
mischief
and
subtlety
and
didseek
in
the
wilderness
for
beasts
of
prey
nephi


and
the
lord
god
said
unto
me
they
shall
be
a
scourge
untothy
seed
to
stir
them
up
in
remembrance
of
me
and
inasmuch
asthey
will
not
remember
me
and
hearken
unto
my
words
they
shallscourge
them
even
unto
destruction
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
nephi
did
consecrate
jacob
andjoseph
that
they
should
be
priests
and
teachers
over
the
land
ofmy
people
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
lived
after
the
manner
ofhappiness
nephi


and
thirty
years
had
passed
away
from
the
time
we
leftjerusalem
nephi


and
I
nephi
had
kept
the
records
upon
my
plates
which
Ihad
made
of
my
people
thus
far
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
god
said
unto
me
makeother
plates
and
thou
shalt
engraven
many
things
upon
them
whichare
good
in
my
sight
for
the
profit
of
thy
people
nephi


wherefore
I
nephi
to
be
obedient
to
the
commandments
ofthe
lord
went
and
made
these
plates
upon
which
I
have
engraventhese
things
nephi


and
I
engraved
that
which
is
pleasing
unto
god

and
if
mypeople
are
pleased
with
the
things
of
god
they
will
be
pleasedwith
mine
engravings
which
are
upon
these
plates
nephi


and
if
my
people
desire
to
know
the
more
particular
part
ofthe
history
of
my
people
they
must
search
mine
other
plates
nephi


and
it
sufficeth
me
to
say
that
forty
years
had
passed
awayand
we
had
already
had

and
contentions
with
our

and
now

I
would
speak
unto
you
concerning
thingswhich
are
and
which
are
to
come
wherefore
I
will
read
you
thewords
of
Isaiah

and
they
are
the
words
which
my
brother
hasdesired
that
I
should
speak
unto
you

and
I
speak
unto
you
foryour
sakes
that
ye
may
learn
and
glorify
the
name
of
your

nephi


and
now
the
words
which
I
shall
read
are
they
which
Isaiahspake
concerning
all
the
house
of
Israel
wherefore
they
may

shown
me
that
those

nephi


nevertheless
the
lord
has
shown
unto
me
that
they

and
he
also
has
shown
unto

that
the
lord
godthe
holy

should
manifest

should
manifest
himself
they
should
scourgehim
and
crucify
him
according
to
the
words
of
the
angel
whospake
it
unto

nephi


and
after
they
have
hardened
their
hearts
and
stiffened
theirnecks
against
the
holy

behold
the
judgments
of
theholy

hascovenanted
with

behold
my

I
speak
unto
you
these
thingsthat

ofthe
blessings
which
the

I
know

ye

many
of

I
know
that
ye
know
that
our

mustwaste
away

die
nevertheless
in

bodies
we
shall
see
god
nephi


yea
I
know
that
ye
know
that
in

he
shall
showhimself
unto
those
at
jerusalem
from
whence
we
came
for
it
isexpedient
that
it
should
be
among
them
for
it
behooveth
thegreat
creator
that
he
suffereth
himself
to
become
subject
untoman
in
the
flesh

die
for
all
men

all
men
might
becomesubject

as
death
hath
passed
upon
all

creator
there
must
needs
be
a
power
ofresurrection
and
the
resurrection
must
needs
come
unto
man
byreason
of
the
fall
and
the
fall
came
by
reason
of
transgressionand
because
man
became
fallen
they
were
cut
off
from

the

wherefore
it
must
needs
be
an
infinite
atonementsave
itshould
be
an

this

not

wherefore
the
first
judgment
which
came
upon

needs
have
remained
to
an
endless
duration

and
if
so
thisflesh

have
laid

to
rise
no

nephi


o
the
wisdom
of
god
his
mercy

grace

for
behold
if
theflesh
should
rise
no

our

fell
from

the

and
now
I
jacob
speak
unto
you
again
my
beloved
brethrenconcerning
this
righteous
branch
of
which
I
have
spoken
nephi


for
behold
the
promises
which
we
have
obtained
are
promisesunto
us
according
to
the
flesh
wherefore
as
it
has
been
shownunto
me
that
many
of
our
children
shall
perish
in
the
fleshbecause
of
unbelief
nevertheless
god
will
be
merciful
untomany
and
our
children
shall
be
restored
that
they
may
come
tothat
which
will
give
them
the
true
knowledge
of
their
redeemer
nephi


wherefore
as
I
said
unto
you
it
must
needs
be
expedient
thatchristfor
in
the
last
night
the
angel
spake
unto
me
that
thisshould
be
his
nameshould
come
among
the
jews
among
those
whoare
the
more
wicked
part
of
the
world
and
they
shall
crucifyhimfor
thus
it
behooveth
our
god
and
there
is
none
othernation
on
earth
that
would
crucify
their
god
nephi


for
should
the
mighty
miracles
be
wrought
among
other
nationsthey
would
repent
and
know
that
he
be
their
god
nephi


but
because
of
priestcrafts
and
iniquities
they
at
jerusalemwill
stiffen
their
necks
against
him
that
he
be
crucified
nephi


wherefore
because
of
their
iniquities
destructions
faminespestilences
and
bloodshed
shall
come
upon
them
and
they
whoshall
not
be
destroyed
shall
be
scattered
among
all
nations
nephi


but
behold
thus
saith
the
lord
god
when
the
day
cometh
thatthey
shall
believe
in
me
that
I
am
christ
then
have
Icovenanted
with
their
fathers
that
they
shall
be
restored
in
theflesh
upon
the
earth
unto
the
lands
of
their
inheritance
nephi


and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
they
shall
be
gathered
in
fromtheir
long
dispersion
from
the
isles
of
the
sea
and
from
thefour
parts
of
the
earth
and
the
nations
of
the
gentiles
shall
begreat
in
the
eyes
of
me
saith
god
in
carrying
them
forth
to
thelands
of
their
inheritance
nephi


yea
the
kings
of
the
gentiles
shall
be
nursing
fathers
untothem
and
their
queens
shall
become
nursing
mothers
whereforethe
promises
of
the
lord
are
great
unto
the
gentiles
for
he
hathspoken
it
and
who
can
dispute
nephi


but
behold
this
land
said
god
shall
be
a
land
of
thineinheritance
and
the
gentiles
shall
be
blessed
upon
the
land
nephi


and
this
land
shall
be
a
land
of
liberty
unto
the
gentilesand
there
shall
be
no
kings
upon
the
land
who
shall
raise
upunto
the
gentiles
nephi


and
I
will
fortify
this
land
against
all
other
nations
nephi


and
he
that
fighteth
against
zion
shall
perish
saith
god
nephi


for
he
that
raiseth
up
a
king
against
me
shall
perish
for
Ithe
lord
the
king
of
heaven
will
be
their
king
and
I
will
be
alight
unto
them
forever
that
hear
my
words
nephi


wherefore
for
this
cause
that
my
covenants
may
be
fulfilledwhich
I
have
made
unto
the
children
of
men
that
I
will
do
untothem
while
they
are
in
the
flesh
I
must
needs
destroy
the
secretworks
of
darkness
and
of
murders
and
of
abominations
nephi


wherefore
he
that
fighteth
against
zion
both
jew
andgentile
both
bond
and
free
both
male
and
female
shall
perishfor
they
are
they
who
are
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
for
theywho
are
not
for
me
are
against
me
saith
our
god
nephi


for
I
will
fulfil
my
promises
which
I
have
made
unto
thechildren
of
men
that
I
will
do
unto
them
while
they
are
in
theflesh
nephi


wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
thus
saith
our
god
I
willafflict
thy
seed
by
the
hand
of
the
gentiles
nevertheless
Iwill
soften
the
hearts
of
the
gentiles
that
they
shall
be
likeunto
a
father
to
them
wherefore
the
gentiles
shall
be
blessedand
numbered
among
the
house
of
Israel
nephi


wherefore
I
will
consecrate
this
land
unto
thy
seed
andthem
who
shall
be
numbered
among
thy
seed
forever
for
the
landof
their
inheritance
for
it
is
a
choice
land
saith
god
unto
meabove
all
other
lands
wherefore
I
will
have
all
men
that
dwellthereon
that
they
shall
worship
me
saith
god
nephi


and
now
my
beloved
brethren
seeing
that
our
merciful
godhas
given
us
so
great
knowledge
concerning
these
things
let
usremember
him
and
lay
aside
our
sins
and
not
hang
down
ourheads
for
we
are
not
cast
off
nevertheless
we
have
been
drivenout
of
the
land
of
our
inheritance
but
we
have
been
led
to
abetter
land
for
the
lord
has
made
the
sea
our
path
and
we
areupon
an
isle
of
the
sea
nephi


but
great
are
the
promises
of
the
lord
unto
them
who
are
uponthe
isles
of
the
sea
wherefore
as
it
says
isles
there
mustneeds
be
more
than
this
and
they
are
inhabited
also
by
ourbrethren
nephi


for
behold
the
lord
god
has
led
away
from

to

fromthe
house
of

according
to
his
will
and
pleasure

and
nowbehold
the
lord
remembereth
all
them
who
have
been
broken
offwherefore
he
remembereth
us

remember
that
ye
arefree
to
act
for
yourselvesto

the
way
of

wherefore
my

now
I
nephi
do
speak
somewhat
concerning
the
words
which
Ihave
written
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
Isaiah

forbehold
Isaiah
spake
many
things
which
were
hard
for
many
of
mypeople
to
understand
for
they
know
not
concerning
the
manner
ofprophesying
among
the
jews
nephi


for
I
nephi
have
not
taught
them
many
things
concerning
themanner
of
the
jews
for
their
works
were
works
of
darkness
andtheir
doings
were
doings
of
abominations
nephi


wherefore
I
write
unto
my
people
unto
all
those
that
shallreceive
hereafter
these
things
which
I
write
that
they
may
knowthe
judgments
of
god
that
they
come
upon
all
nations
accordingto
the
word
which
he
hath
spoken
nephi


wherefore
hearken
o
my
people
which
are
of
the
house
ofIsrael
and
give
ear
unto
my
words
for
because
the
words
ofIsaiah
are
not
plain
unto
you
nevertheless
they
are
plain
untoall
those
that
are
filled
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy

but
Igive
unto
you
a
prophecy
according
to
the
spirit
which
is
in
mewherefore
I
shall
prophesy
according
to
the
plainness
which
hathbeen
with
me
from
the
time
that
I
came
out
from
jerusalem
with
myfather
for
behold
my
soul
delighteth
in
plainness
unto
mypeople
that
they
may
learn
nephi


yea
and
my
soul
delighteth
in
the
words
of
Isaiah
for
I
cameout
from
jerusalem
and
mine
eyes
hath
beheld
the
things
of
thejews
and
I
know
that
the
jews
do
understand
the
things
of
theprophets
and
there
is
none
other
people
that
understand
thethings
which
were
spoken
unto
the
jews
like
unto
them
save
it
bethat
they
are
taught
after
the
manner
of
the
things
of
the
jews
nephi


but
behold
I
nephi
have
not
taught
my
children
after
themanner
of
the
jews
but
behold
I
of
myself
have
dwelt
atjerusalem
wherefore
I
know
concerning
the
regions
round
aboutand
I
have
made
mention
unto
my
children
concerning
the
judgmentsof
god
which
hath
come
to
pass
among
the
jews
unto
my
childrenaccording
to
all
that
which
Isaiah
hath
spoken
and
I
do
notwrite
them
nephi


but
behold
I
proceed
with
mine
own
prophecy
according
to
myplainness
in
the
which
I
know
that
no
man
can
err
neverthelessin
the
days
that
the
prophecies
of
Isaiah
shall
be
fulfilled
menshall
know
of
a
surety
at
the
times
when
they
shall
come
topass
nephi


wherefore
they
are
of
worth
unto
the
children
of
men
and
hethat
supposeth
that
they
are
not
unto
them
will
I
speakparticularly
and
confine
the
words
unto
mine
own
people
for
Iknow
that
they
shall
be
of
great
worth
unto
them
in
the
lastdays
for
in
that
day
shall
they
understand
them
wherefore
fortheir
good
have
I
written
them
nephi


and
as
one
generation
hath
been
destroyed
among
the
jewsbecause
of
iniquity
even
so
have
they
been
destroyed
fromgeneration
to
generation
according
to
their
iniquities
and
neverhath
any
of
them
been
destroyed
save
it
were
foretold
them
by
theprophets
of
the
lord
nephi


wherefore
it
hath
been
told
them
concerning
the
destructionwhich
should
come
upon
them
immediately
after
my
father
leftjerusalem
nevertheless
they
hardened
their
hearts
andaccording
to
my
prophecy
they
have
been
destroyed
save
it
bethose
which
are
carried
away
captive
into
babylon
nephi


and
now
this
I
speak
because
of
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
and
notwithstanding
they
have
been
carried
away
they
shall
returnagain
and
possess
the
land
of
jerusalem
wherefore
they
shallbe
restored
again
to
the
land
of
their
inheritance
nephi


but
behold
they
shall
have
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
andwhen
the
day
cometh
that
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
yeaeven
the
father
of
heaven
and
of
earth
shall
manifest
himselfunto
them
in
the
flesh
behold
they
will
reject
him
because
oftheir
iniquities
and
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
thestiffness
of
their
necks
nephi


behold
they
will
crucify
him
and
after
he
is
laid
in
asepulchre
for
the
space
of
three
days
he
shall
rise
from
thedead
with
healing
in
his
wings
and
all
those
who
shall
believeon
his
name
shall
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
god

wherefore
mysoul
delighteth
to
prophesy
concerning
him
for
I
have
seen
hisday
and
my
heart
doth
magnify
his
holy
name
nephi


and
behold
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
after
the
messiah
hathrisen
from
the
dead
and
hath
manifested
himself
unto
his
peopleunto
as
many
as
will
believe
on

behold
jerusalem
shallbe
destroyed
again
for
wo
unto
them
that

wherefore
the

worship
thefather
in
his
name
with
pure
hearts
and
clean
hands
and
looknot
forward
any
more
for
another
messiah
then
at
that
time
theday
will
come
that
it
must
needs
be
expedient
that
they
shouldbelieve
these
things
nephi


and
the
lord
will
set
his
hand
again
the
second
time
torestore
his
people
from
their
lost
and
fallen
state

whereforehe
will
proceed
to
do
a
marvelous
work
and
a
wonder
among
thechildren
of
men
nephi


wherefore
he
shall
bring
forth
his
words
unto
them
whichwords
shall
judge
them
at
the
last
day
for
they
shall
be
giventhem
for
the
purpose
of
convincing
them
of
the
true
messiah
whowas
rejected
by
them
and
unto
the
convincing
of
them
that
theyneed
not
look
forward
any
more
for
a
messiah
to
come
for
thereshould
not
any
come
save
it
should
be
a
false
messiah
whichshould
deceive
the
people
for
there
is
save
one
messiah
spokenof
by
the
prophets
and
that
messiah
is
he
who
should
be
rejectedof
the
jews
nephi


for
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
the
messiahcometh
in
six
hundred
years
from
the
time
that
my
father
leftjerusalem
and
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
and
alsothe
word
of
the
angel
of
god
his
name
shall
be
jesus
christ
theson
of
god
nephi


and
now
my
brethren
I
have
spoken
plainly
that
ye
cannoterr

and
as
the
lord
god
liveth
that
brought
Israel
up
out
ofthe
land
of
egypt
and
gave
unto
moses
power
that
he
should
healthe
nations
after
they
had
been
bitten
by
the
poisonous
serpentsif
they
would
cast
their
eyes
unto
the
serpent
which
he
did
raiseup
before
them
and
also
gave
him
power
that
he
should
smite
therock
and
the
water
should
come
forth
yea
behold
I
say
unto
youthat
as
these
things
are
true
and
as
the
lord
god
liveth
thereis
none
other
name
given
under
heaven
save
it
be
this
jesuschrist
of
which
I
have
spoken
whereby
man
can
be
saved
nephi


wherefore
for
this
cause
hath
the
lord
god
promised
unto
methat
these
things
which
I
write
shall
be
kept
and
preserved
andhanded
down
unto
my
seed
from
generation
to
generation
that
thepromise
may
be
fulfilled
unto
joseph
that
his
seed
should
neverperish
as
long
as
the
earth
should
stand
nephi


wherefore
these
things
shall
go
from
generation
togeneration
as
long
as
the
earth
shall
stand
and
they
shall
goaccording
to
the
will
and
pleasure
of
god
and
the
nations
whoshall
possess
them
shall
be
judged
of
them
according
to
the
wordswhich
are
written
nephi


for
we
labor
diligently
to
write
to
persuade
our
childrenand
also
our
brethren
to
believe
in
christ
and
to
be
reconciledto
god
for
we
know
that
it
is
by
grace
that
we
are
saved
afterall
we
can
do
nephi


and
notwithstanding
we
believe
in
christ
we
keep
the
law
ofmoses
and
look
forward
with
steadfastness
unto
christ
until
thelaw
shall
be
fulfilled
nephi


for
for
this
end
was
the
law
given
wherefore
the
law
hathbecome
dead
unto
us
and
we
are
made
alive
in
christ
because
ofour
faith
yet
we
keep
the
law
because
of
the
commandments
nephi


and
we
talk
of
christ
we
rejoice
in
christ
we
preach
ofchrist
we
prophesy
of
christ
and
we
write
according
to
ourprophecies
that
our
children
may
know
to
what
source
they
maylook
for
a
remission
of
their
sins
nephi


wherefore
we
speak
concerning
the
law
that
our
children
mayknow
the
deadness
of
the
law
and
they
by
knowing
the
deadnessof
the
law
may
look
forward
unto
that
life
which
is
in
christand
know
for
what
end
the
law
was
given

and
after
the
law
isfulfilled
in
christ
that
they
need
not
harden
their
heartsagainst
him
when
the
law
ought
to
be
done
away
nephi


and
now
behold
my
people
ye
are
a
stiffnecked
peoplewherefore
I
have
spoken
plainly
unto
you
that
ye
cannotmisunderstand

and
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
shall
stand
asa
testimony
against
you
for
they
are
sufficient
to
teach
any
manthe
right
way
for
the
right
way
is
to
believe
in
christ
and
denyhim
not
for
by
denying
him
ye
also
deny
the
prophets
and
thelaw
nephi


and
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
the
right
way
is
tobelieve
in
christ
and
deny
him
not
and
christ
is
the
holy
oneof
Israel
wherefore
ye
must
bow
down
before
him
and
worship
himwith
all
your
might
mind
and
strength
and
your
whole
soul
andif
ye
do
this
ye
shall
in
nowise
be
cast
out
nephi


and
inasmuch
as
it
shall
be
expedient
ye
must
keep
theperformances
and
ordinances
of
god
until
the
law
shall
befulfilled
which
was
given
unto
moses
nephi

nephi


and
after
christ
shall
have
risen
from
the
dead
he
shall
showhimself
unto
you
my
children
and
my
beloved
brethren
and
thewords
which
he
shall
speak
unto
you
shall
be
the
law
which
yeshall
do

for
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
I
have
beheld
that
manygenerations
shall
pass
away
and
there
shall
be
great
wars
andcontentions
among
my
people
nephi


and
after
the
messiah
shall
come
there
shall
be
signs
givenunto
my
people
of
his
birth
and
also
of
his
death
andresurrection
and
great
and
terrible
shall
that
day
be
unto
thewicked
for
they
shall
perish

they
perish

they
castout
the

stone
them

slay
themwherefore
the
cry
of
the
blood
of
the

shall
ascend
up

against

wherefore
all
those
who
are
proud
and
that
do
wickedly
theday
that
cometh
shall
burn
them
up
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
forthey
shall
be
as
stubble

and
they
that
kill
the
prophets
and
the
saints
the
depths
ofthe

shall
swallow

up
saith
the
lord

and
they
shall
be
visited
with
thunderings
and
lightningsand
earthquakes
and
all
manner
of
destructions
for
the
fire
ofthe
anger
of
the
lord
shall
be
kindled
against

and
theyshall
be
as
stubble
and
the
day
that
cometh
shall
consume
themsaith
the
lord
of
hosts
nephi


o
the
pain
and
the
anguish
of
my
soul
for
the
loss
of
theslain
of
my
people

for
I
nephi
have
seen
it
and
it
well
nighconsumeth
me
before
the
presence
of
the
lord
but
I
must
cry
untomy
god
thy
ways
are
just
nephi


but
behold
the
righteous
that
hearken
unto
the
words
of
theprophets
and
destroy
them
not
but
look
forward
unto
christ
withsteadfastness
for
the
signs
which
are
given
notwithstanding
allpersecutionbehold
they
are
they
which
shall
not
perish
nephi


but
the
son
of
righteousness
shall
appear
unto
them
and
heshall
heal
them
and
they
shall
have
peace
with
him
until
threegenerations
shall
have
passed
away
and
many
of
the
fourthgeneration
shall
have
passed
away
in
righteousness
nephi


and
when
these
things
have
passed
away
a
speedy
destructioncometh
unto
my
people
for
notwithstanding
the
pains
of
my
soulI
have
seen
it
wherefore
I
know
that
it
shall
come
to
pass
andthey
sell
themselves
for
naught
for
for
the
reward
of
theirpride
and
their
foolishness
they
shall
reap
destruction
forbecause
they
yield
unto
the
devil
and
choose
works
of
darknessrather
than
light
therefore
they
must
go
down
to
hell
nephi


for
the
spirit
of
the
lord
will
not
always
strive
with
man
and
when
the
spirit
ceaseth
to
strive
with
man
then
cometh
speedydestruction
and
this
grieveth
my
soul
nephi


and
as
I
spake
concerning
the
convincing
of
the
jews
thatjesus
is
the
very
christ
it
must
needs
be
that
the
gentiles
beconvinced
also
that
jesus
is
the
christ
the
eternal
god
nephi


and
that
he
manifesteth
himself
unto
all
those
who
believe
inhim
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
yea
unto
every
nationkindred
tongue
and
people
working
mighty
miracles
signs
andwonders
among
the
children
of
men
according
to
their
faith
nephi


but
behold
I
prophesy
unto
you
concerning
the
last
daysconcerning
the
days
when
the
lord
god
shall
bring
these
thingsforth
unto
the
children
of
men
nephi


after
my
seed
and
the
seed
of
my
brethren
shall
have
dwindledin
unbelief
and
shall
have
been
smitten
by
the
gentiles
yeaafter
the
lord
god
shall
have
camped
against
them
round
aboutand
shall
have
laid
siege
against
them
with
a
mount
and
raisedforts
against
them
and
after
they
shall
have
been
brought
downlow
in
the
dust
even
that
they
are
not
yet
the
words
of
therighteous
shall
be
written
and
the
prayers
of
the
faithful
shallbe
heard
and
all
those
who
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
shall
notbe
forgotten
nephi


for
those
who
shall
be
destroyed
shall
speak
unto
them
out
ofthe
ground
and
their
speech
shall
be
low
out
of
the
dust
andtheir
voice
shall
be
as
one
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit
for
thelord
god
will
give
unto
him
power
that
he
may
whisper
concerningthem
even
as
it
were
out
of
the
ground
and
their
speech
shallwhisper
out
of
the
dust
nephi


for
thus
saith
the
lord
god
they
shall
write
the
thingswhich
shall
be
done
among
them
and
they
shall
be
written
andsealed
up
in
a
book
and
those
who
have
dwindled
in
unbeliefshall
not
have
them
for
they
seek
to
destroy
the
things
of
god
nephi


wherefore
as
those
who
have
been
destroyed
have
beendestroyed
speedily
and
the
multitude
of
their
terrible
onesshall
be
as
chaff
that
passeth
awayyea
thus
saith
the
lordgod
It
shall
be
at
an
instant
suddenly
nephi


and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
those
who
have
dwindled
inunbelief
shall
be
smitten
by
the
hand
of
the
gentiles
nephi


and
the
gentiles
are
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
eyesand
have
stumbled
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
stumblingblock
that
they
have
built
up
many
churches
nevertheless
theyput
down
the
power
and
miracles
of
god
and
preach
up
untothemselves
their
own
wisdom
and
their
own
learning
that
they
mayget
gain
and
grind
upon
the
face
of
the
poor
nephi


and
there
are
many
churches
built
up
which
cause
envyingsand
strifes
and
malice
nephi


and
there
are
also
secret
combinations
even
as
in
times
ofold
according
to
the
combinations
of
the
devil
for
he
is
thefounder
of
all
these
things
yea
the
founder
of
murder
andworks
of
darkness
yea
and
he
leadeth
them
by
the
neck
with
aflaxen
cord
until
he
bindeth
them
with
his
strong
cords
forever
nephi


for
behold
my
beloved
brethren
I
say
unto
you
that
the
lordgod
worketh
not
in
darkness
nephi


he
doeth
not
anything
save
it
be
for
the
benefit
of
theworld
for
he
loveth
the
world
even
that
he
layeth
down
his
ownlife
that
he
may
draw
all
men
unto
him

wherefore
he
commandethnone
that
they
shall
not
partake
of
his
salvation
nephi


behold
doth
he
cry
unto
any
saying
depart
from
me
behold
I
say
unto
you
nay
but
he
saith
come
unto
me
all
yeends
of
the
earth
buy
milk
and
honey
without
money
and
withoutprice
nephi


behold
hath
he
commanded
any
that
they
should
depart
out
ofthe
synagogues
or
out
of
the
houses
of
worship

behold
I
sayunto
you
nay
nephi


hath
he
commanded
any
that
they
should
not
partake
of
hissalvation

behold
I
say
unto
you
nay
but
he
hath
given
it
freefor
all
men
and
he
hath
commanded
his
people
that
they
shouldpersuade
all
men
to
repentance
nephi


behold
hath
the
lord
commanded
any
that
they
should
notpartake
of
his
goodness

behold
I
say
unto
you
nay
but
all
menare
privileged
the
one
like
unto
the
other
and
none
areforbidden
nephi


he
commandeth
that
there
shall
be
no
priestcrafts
forbehold
priestcrafts
are
that
men
preach
and
set
themselves
up
fora
light
unto
the
world
that
they
may
get
gain
and
praise
of
theworld
but
they
seek
not
the
welfare
of
zion
nephi


behold
the
lord
hath
forbidden
this
thing
wherefore
thelord
god
hath
given
a
commandment
that
all
men
should
havecharity
which
charity
is
love
and
except
they
should
havecharity
they
were
nothing

wherefore
if
they
should
havecharity
they
would
not
suffer
the
laborer
in
zion
to
perish
nephi


but
the
laborer
in
zion
shall
labor
for
zion
for
if
theylabor
for
money
they
shall
perish
nephi


and
again
the
lord
god
hath
commanded
that
men
should
notmurder
that
they
should
not
lie
that
they
should
not
stealthat
they
should
not
take
the

wherefore
the

I
pray
thee

andthe

bring

and
now
because
of
the
glory
of

and
to

gainwill
they
say
this
and
not
for
the
glory
of

nephi


and
the
man
shall

I
cannot

for
it
issealed

then
shall

say
I
cannot

wherefore
it
shall

that
the

thereof
to
him
that

then
shall
the

say
unto

the

shall
notread
them
for
they
have
rejected
them
and
I

wherefore
thou
shalt
read
the
words
which
I
shall
giveunto
thee
nephi


touch
not
the
things
which
are
sealed
for
I
will
bring

for
I
will
show
unto
the
children
ofmen
that
I
am
able

wherefore
when
thou
hast

which
I
have
promisedunto

then
shalt
thou
seal
up

again
and
hide
it
upunto
me
that
I
may
preserve
the
words
which
thou
hast
not

I
shall
see
fit
in
mine
own
wisdom
to
reveal
all

the
children

for
behold
I
am

I
am
a

and
I
willshow
unto

and
I
work
not
among
the

save
it
beaccording
to
their
faith
nephi


and
again
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
lord
shall
say
untohim
that
shall
read
the
words
that
shall
be
delivered

nephi


forasmuch
as
this
people
draw
near
unto
me
with
their
mouthand
with
their
lips
do
honor
me
but
have
removed
their
heartsfar
from
me
and
their
fear
towards
me
is
taught
by
the
preceptsof
men
nephi


therefore
I
will
proceed
to
do
a
marvelous
work
among
thispeople
yea
a
marvelous
work
and
a
wonder
for
the
wisdom
oftheir
wise
and
learned
shall
perish
and
the
understanding
oftheir
prudent
shall
be
hid
nephi


and
wo
unto
them
that
seek
deep
to
hide
their
counsel
fromthe

and
their
works
are
in

they
say
whoseeth
us

who
knoweth
us

and
they
also
say
surely
yourturning
of
things
upside
down
shall
be
esteemed
as
the
pottersclay

but
behold
I
will
show
unto
them
saith
the
lord
ofhosts
that
I
know
all
their
works

for
shall
the
work
say
ofhim
that
made
it
he
made
me
not

or
shall
the
thing
framed
sayof
him
that
framed
it
he
had
no

nephi


but
behold
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
I
will
show
unto
thechildren
of

that
it
is
yet
a
very
little
while
and
lebanonshall
be
turned
into
a
fruitful
field
and
the
fruitful
fieldshall
be
esteemed
as
a

and
in
that
day
shall
the
deaf
hear
the
words
of
the
bookand
the
eyes
of
the
blind
shall
see
out
of
obscurity
and
out
ofdarkness
nephi


and
the
meek
also
shall
increase
and
their
joy
shall
be
inthe
lord
and
the
poor
among
men
shall
rejoice
in
the
holy
one
ofIsrael
nephi


for
assuredly
as
the
lord
liveth
they
shall
see
that
theterrible
one
is
brought
to
naught
and
the
scorner
is
consumedand
all
that
watch
for
iniquity
are
cut
off

and
they
that
make
a

for

lay
asnare
for
him
that
reproveth
in

and
turn
aside

therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
who
redeemed

when

they
shall
sanctify

they

and
now
behold
my
beloved

I
would
speak
unto
youfor
I
nephi
would
not
suffer
that

righteous
than

except
yeshall
keep

unto

of
the

believe
thewords

they
shall
carry
them
forth
unto
theremnant

and
then
shall
the
remnant
of
our

know
concerning

howthat
we
came
out
from

that
they

and
now
I
nephi
make
an
end
of
my
prophesying
unto
you
mybeloved
brethren

and
I
cannot
write
but
a
few
things
which
Iknow
must
surely
come
to
pass
neither
can
I
write
but
a
few
ofthe
words
of
my
brother
jacob
nephi


wherefore
the
things
which
I
have
written
sufficeth
me
saveit
be
a
few
words
which
I
must
speak
concerning
the
doctrine
ofchrist
wherefore
I
shall
speak
unto
you
plainly
according
tothe
plainness
of
my
prophesying
nephi


for
my
soul
delighteth
in
plainness
for
after
this
mannerdoth
the
lord
god
work
among
the
children
of
men

for
the
lordgod
giveth
light
unto
the
understanding
for
he
speaketh
unto
menaccording
to
their
language
unto
their
understanding
nephi


wherefore
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
I
have
spokenunto
you
concerning
that
prophet
which
the
lord
showed
unto
methat
should
baptize
the
lamb
of
god
which
should
take
away
thesins
of
the
world
nephi


and
now
if
the
lamb
of
god
he
being
holy
should
have
needto
be
baptized
by
water
to
fulfil
all
righteousness
o
then
howmuch
more
need
have
we
being
unholy
to
be
baptized
yea
evenby
water
nephi


and
now
I
would
ask
of
you
my
beloved
brethren
wherein
thelamb
of
god
did
fulfil
all
righteousness
in
being
baptized
bywater
nephi


know
ye
not
that
he
was
holy

but
notwithstanding
he
beingholy
he
showeth
unto
the
children
of
men
that
according
to
theflesh
he
humbleth
himself
before
the
father
and
witnesseth
untothe
father
that
he
would
be
obedient
unto
him
in
keeping
hiscommandments
nephi


wherefore
after
he
was
baptized
with
water
the
holy
ghostdescended
upon
him
in
the
form
of
a
dove
nephi


and
again
it
showeth
unto
the
children
of
men
thestraightness
of
the
path
and
the
narrowness
of
the
gate
bywhich
they
should
enter
he
having
set
the
example
before
them
nephi


and
he
said
unto
the
children
of
men
follow
thou
me
wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
can
we
follow
jesus
save
we
shallbe
willing
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
father
nephi


and
the
father
said
repent
ye
repent
ye
and
be
baptized
inthe
name
of
my
beloved
son
nephi


and
also
the
voice
of
the
son
came
unto
me
saying
he
thatis
baptized
in
my
name
to
him
will
the
father
give
the
holyghost
like
unto
me
wherefore
follow
me
and
do
the
thingswhich
ye
have
seen
me
do
nephi


wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
I
know
that
if
ye
shallfollow
the
son
with
full
purpose
of
heart
acting
no
hypocrisyand
no
deception
before
god
but
with
real
intent
repenting
ofyour
sins
witnessing
unto
the
father
that
ye
are
willing
to
takeupon
you
the
name
of
christ
by
baptismyea
by
following
yourlord
and
your
savior
down
into
the
water
according
to
his
wordbehold
then
shall
ye
receive
the
holy
ghost
yea
then
comeththe
baptism
of
fire
and
of
the
holy
ghost
and
then
can
ye
speakwith
the
tongue
of
angels
and
shout
praises
unto
the
holy
one
ofIsrael
nephi


but
behold
my
beloved
brethren
thus
came
the
voice
of
theson
unto
me
saying
after
ye
have
repented
of
your
sins
andwitnessed
unto
the
father
that
ye
are
willing
to
keep
mycommandments
by
the
baptism
of
water
and
have
received
thebaptism
of
fire
and
of
the
holy
ghost
and
can
speak
with
a
newtongue
yea
even
with
the
tongue
of
angels
and
after
thisshould
deny
me
it
would
have
been
better
for
you
that
ye
had
notknown
me
nephi


and
I
heard
a
voice
from
the
father
saying
yea
the
wordsof
my
beloved
are
true
and
faithful

he
that
endureth
to
theend
the
same
shall
be
saved
nephi


and
now
my
beloved
brethren
I
know
by
this
that
unless
aman
shall
endure
to
the
end
in
following
the
example
of
the
sonof
the
living
god
he
cannot
be
saved
nephi


wherefore
do
the
things
which
I
have
told
you
I
have
seenthat
your
lord
and
your
redeemer
should
do
for
for
this
causehave
they
been
shown
unto
me
that
ye
might
know
the
gate
bywhich
ye
should
enter

for
the
gate
by
which
ye
should
enter
isrepentance
and
baptism
by
water
and
then
cometh
a
remission
ofyour
sins
by
fire
and
by
the
holy
ghost
nephi


and
then
are
ye
in
this
strait
and
narrow
path
which
leads
toeternal
life
yea
ye
have
entered
in
by
the
gate
ye
have
doneaccording
to
the
commandments
of
the
father
and
the
son
and
yehave
received
the
holy
ghost
which
witnesses
of
the
father
andthe
son
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
promise
which
he
hath
madethat
if
ye
entered
in
by
the
way
ye
should
receive
nephi


and
now
my
beloved
brethren
after
ye
have
gotten
into
thisstrait
and
narrow
path
I
would
ask
if
all
is
done

behold
Isay
unto
you
nay
for
ye
have
not
come
thus
far
save
it
were
bythe
word
of
christ
with
unshaken
faith
in
him
relying
whollyupon
the
merits
of
him
who
is
mighty
to
save

wherefore
ye
must
press
forward
with
a
steadfastness
inchrist
having
a
perfect
brightness
of
hope
and
a
love
of
godand
of
all
men

wherefore
if
ye
shall
press
forward
feastingupon
the
word
of

and
endure
to
the
end
behold
thussaith
the

the
way
andthere
is
none
other
way
nor
name
given
under

whereby
mancan
be

and
now
behold
this
is
thedoctrine
of

and
the
only
and

behold
my

suppose
that
ye
pondersomewhat
in

concerning

but
behold
why
do
ye
ponderthese
things
in
your

nephi


do
ye
not
remember
that
I
said
unto
you
that
after
ye
hadreceived
the
holy
ghost
ye
could
speak
with
the
tongue
of
angelsand
now
how
could
ye
speak
with
the
tongue
of
angels
save
itwere
by
the
holy
ghost
nephi


angels
speak
by
the
power
of
the

wherefore
theyspeak
the
words

wherefore
I
said
unto
you
feastupon
the
words
of

for
behold
the
words
of

willtell
you
all
things
what
ye
should
do

wherefore
now
after
I
have
spoken
these
words
if
ye
cannotunderstand
them
it
will
be
because
ye
ask
not
neither
do
yeknock
wherefore
ye
are
not
brought
into

light
but
mustperish
in
the
dark
nephi


for
behold
again
I
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
will
enter
in
bythe
way
and
receive
the
holy
ghost
it
will
show
unto
you
allthings
what
ye
should
do
nephi


behold
this
is
the
doctrine
of
christ
and
there
will
be
nomore
doctrine
given
until
after
he
shall
manifest
himself
untoyou
in

and
when
he
shall
manifest
himself
unto

inthe

the
things
which
he
shall
say
unto

shall
yeobserve
to
do
nephi


and
now
I
nephi
cannot
say
more
the
spirit
stoppeth
mineutterance
and
I
am
left
to
mourn
because
of
the
unbelief
andthe
wickedness
and
the
ignorance
and
the
stiffneckedness
ofmen

they
will
not
search
knowledge
nor
understand
greatknowledge

is
given

even
as
plainas

and
now
my
beloved
brethren
I
perceive
that
ye
ponder
stillin
your
hearts
and
it
grieveth
me
that
I
must
speak
concerningthis
thing

for
if
ye
would
hearken
unto
the

whichteacheth
a

ye
would
know
that
ye

pray
for

teacheth
not
a

to

teacheth
him
that
hemust
not

nephi


but
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
ye
must
pray
always
and
notfaint
that
ye
must
not
perform
any
thing
unto
the

save
inthe
first
place
ye
shall
pray
unto
the

and
now
I
nephi
cannot
write
all
the
things
which
weretaught
among

neither
am
I
mighty
in

theycast
many

I
nephi
have
written
what

hear
my

and
I
know
that
the

will
consecrate
my

forthe

and
the
words
which
I
have
written

be
made

it
persuadeth

todo
good
it

persuadeth

it
speaketh
harshly

jacob


for
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
fifty
and
five
years
hadpassed
away
from
the
time
that
lehi
left
jerusalem
whereforenephi
gave
me
jacob
a
commandment
concerning
the
small
platesupon
which
these
things
are
engravenjacob


and
he
gave
me
jacob
a
commandment
that
I
should
write
uponthese
plates
a
few
of
the
things
which
I
consider
to
be
mostprecious
that
I
should
not
touch
save
it
were
lightlyconcerning
the
history
of
this
people
which
are
called
the
peopleof
nephijacob


for
he
said
that
the
history
of
his
people
should
be
engravenupon
his
other
plates
and
that
I
should
preserve
these
platesand
hand
them
down
unto
my
seed
from
generation
to
generationjacob


and
if
there
were
preaching
which
was
sacred
or
revelationwhich
was
great
or
prophesying
that
I
should
engraven
the
headsof
them
upon
these
plates
and
touch
upon
them
as
much
as
it
werepossible
for
christs
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
our
peoplejacob


for
because
of
faith
and
great
anxiety
it
truly
had
been
mademanifest
unto
us
concerning
our
people
what
things
should
happenunto
themjacob


and
we
also
had
many
revelations
and
the
spirit
of
muchprophecy
wherefore
we
knew
of
christ
and
his
kingdom
whichshould
comejacob


wherefore
we
labored
diligently
among
our
people
that
wemight
persuade
them
to
come
unto
christ
and
partake
of
thegoodness
of
god
that
they
might
enter
into
his
rest
lest
by
anymeans
he
should
swear
in
his
wrath
they
should
not
enter
in
asin
the
provocation
in
the
days
of
temptation
while
the
childrenof
Israel
were
in
the
wildernessjacob


wherefore
we
would
to
god
that
we
could
persuade
all
men
notto
rebel
against
god
to
provoke
him
to
anger
but
that
all
menwould
believe
in
christ
and
view
his
death
and
suffer
his
crossand
bear
the
shame
of
the
world
wherefore
I
jacob
take
itupon
me
to
fulfil
the
commandment
of
my
brother
nephijacob


now
nephi
began
to
be
old
and
he
saw
that
he
must
soon
diewherefore
he
anointed
a
man
to
be
a
king
and
a
ruler
over
hispeople
now
according
to
the
reigns
of
the
kingsjacob


the
people
having
loved
nephi
exceedingly
he
having
been
agreat
protector
for
them
having
wielded
the
sword
of
laban
intheir
defence
and
having
labored
in
all
his
days
for
theirwelfarejacob


wherefore
the
people
were
desirous
to
retain
in
remembrancehis
name

and
whoso
should
reign
in
his
stead
were
called
by
thepeople
second
nephi
third
nephi
and
so
forth
according
to
thereigns
of
the
kings
and
thus
they
were
called
by
the
people
letthem
be
of
whatever
name
they
wouldjacob


and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
diedjacob


now
the
people
which
were
not
lamanites
were
nephitesnevertheless
they
were
called
nephites
jacobites
josephiteszoramites
lamanites
lemuelites
and
Ishmaelitesjacob


but
I
jacob
shall
not
hereafter
distinguish
them
by
thesenames
but
I
shall
call
them
lamanites
that
seek
to
destroy
thepeople
of
nephi
and
those
who
are
friendly
to
nephi
I
shall
callnephites
or
the
people
of
nephi
according
to
the
reigns
of
thekingsjacob


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
nephi
under
thereign
of
the
second
king
began
to
grow
hard
in
their
hearts
andindulge
themselves
somewhat
in
wicked
practices
such
as
likeunto
david
of
old
desiring
many
wives
and
concubines
and
alsosolomon
his
sonjacob


yea
and
they
also
began
to
search
much
gold
and
silver
andbegan
to
be
lifted
up
somewhat
in
pridejacob


wherefore
I
jacob
gave
unto
them
these
words
as
I
taughtthem
in
the
temple
having
first
obtained
mine
errand
from
thelordjacob


for
I
jacob
and
my
brother
joseph
had
been
consecratedpriests
and
teachers
of
this
people
by
the
hand
of
nephijacob


and
we
did
magnify
our
office
unto
the
lord
taking
upon
usthe
responsibility
answering
the
sins
of
the
people
upon
our
ownheads
if
we
did
not
teach
them
the
word
of

with
alldiligence
wherefore
by
laboring
with
our
might
their
bloodmight
not
come

otherwise
their

wouldcome
upon

we

the

now
my

I
jacob
according
to
theresponsibility
which
I
am
under
to

to
magnify
mine
officewith
soberness
and
that
I
might
rid

Icome
up
into

this
day

I
might
declare
unto
youthe
word
of

and
ye
yourselves
know
that
I
have
hitherto
been
diligent
inthe
office

I
this
day
am
weighed
down
withmuch
more
desire
and
anxiety
for
the
welfare
of
your
souls
than
Ihave
hitherto
beenjacob


for
behold
as
yet
ye
have
been
obedient
unto
the
word
of
thelord
which
I
have
given
unto

but
behold
hearken
ye
unto
me
and
know
that
by
the
help
ofthe
allpowerful
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
I
can
tell
youconcerning
your
thoughts
how
that
ye
are
beginning
to
labor
insin
which
sin
appeareth
very
abominable
unto
me
yea
andabominable
unto
godjacob


yea
it
grieveth
my
soul
and
causeth
me
to
shrink
with
shamebefore
the
presence
of
my
maker
that
I
must
testify
unto
youconcerning
the
wickedness
of
your
heartsjacob


and
also
it
grieveth
me
that
I
must
use
so
much
boldness
ofspeech
concerning
you
before
your
wives
and
your
children
manyof
whose
feelings
are
exceedingly
tender
and
chaste
and
delicatebefore
god
which
thing
is
pleasing
unto
godjacob


and
it
supposeth
me
that
they
have
come
up
hither
to
hear
thepleasing
word
of
god
yea
the
word
which
healeth
the
woundedsouljacob


wherefore
it
burdeneth
my
soul
that
I
should
be
constrainedbecause
of
the
strict
commandment
which
I
have
received
from
godto
admonish
you
according
to
your
crimes
to
enlarge
the
woundsof
those
who
are
already
wounded
instead
of
consoling
andhealing
their
wounds
and
those
who
have
not
been
woundedinstead
of
feasting
upon
the
pleasing
word
of
god
have
daggersplaced
to
pierce
their
souls
and
wound
their
delicate
mindsjacob


but
notwithstanding
the
greatness
of
the
task
I
must
doaccording
to
the
strict
commands
of
god
and
tell
you
concerningyour
wickedness
and
abominations
in
the
presence
of
the
pure
inheart
and
the
broken
heart
and
under
the
glance
of
the
piercingeye
of
the
almighty
godjacob


wherefore
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
according
to
theplainness
of
the
word
of

for
behold
as
I
inquired
of
thelord
thus
came
the
word
unto
me
saying

jacob
get
thou
upinto
the
temple
on
the
morrow
and
declare
the
word
which
I
shallgive
thee
unto
this
peoplejacob


and
now
behold
my
brethren
this
is
the
word
which
I
declareunto
you
that
many
of
you
have
begun
to
search
for
gold
and
forsilver
and
for
all
manner
of
precious
ores
in
the
which
thisland
which
is
a
land
of
promise
unto
you
and
to
your

dothabound
most
plentifullyjacob


and
the
hand
of
providence
hath
smiled
upon
you
mostpleasingly
that
you
have
obtained
many
riches
and
because
someof
you
have
obtained
more
abundantly
than
that
of
your
brethrenye
are
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
your
hearts
and
wear
stiffnecks
and
high
heads
because
of
the
costliness
of
your
appareland
persecute
your
brethren
because
ye
suppose
that
ye
are
betterthan
theyjacob


and
now
my
brethren
do
ye
suppose
that
god
justifieth
youin
this
thing

behold
I
say
unto
you
nay

but
he
condemnethyou
and
if
ye
persist
in
these
things
his
judgments
mustspeedily
come
unto
youjacob


o
that
he
would
show
you
that
he
can
pierce
you
and
with
oneglance
of
his
eye
he
can
smite
you
to
the
dustjacob


o
that
he
would
rid
you
from
this
iniquity
and
abomination
and
o
that
ye
would
listen
unto
the
word
of
his
commands
andlet
not
this
pride
of
your

destroy
your

think
of
your
brethren
like
unto
yourselves
and
be
familiarwith
all
and
free
with
your
substance
that
they
may
be
rich
likeunto
youjacob


but
before
ye
seek
for
riches
seek
ye
for
the
kingdom
ofgodjacob


and
after
ye
have
obtained
a
hope
in

ye
shall
obtainriches
if
ye
seek
them
and
ye
will
seek
them
for
the
intent
todo
goodto
clothe
the
naked
and
to
feed
the
hungry
and
toliberate
the
captive
and
administer
relief
to
the
sick
and
theafflictedjacob


and
now
my
brethren
I
have
spoken
unto
you
concerningpride
and
those
of
you
which
have
afflicted
your
neighbor
andpersecuted
him
because
ye
were
proud
in
your
hearts
of
thethings
which
god
hath
given
you
what
say
ye
of
itjacob


do
ye
not
suppose
that
such
things
are
abominable
unto
himwho
created
all
flesh

and
the
one
being
is
as
precious
in
hissight
as
the
other

and
all
flesh
is
of
the
dust
and
for
theselfsame
end
hath
he
created
them
that
they
should
keep
hiscommandments
and
glorify
him
foreverjacob


and
now
I
make
an
end

speaking
unto

concerning
thispride

were
it
not
that
I
must
speak
unto

concerning
agrosser
crime
my

rejoice

but
the
word

burdens

behold
thus
saith
the

theyseek
to
excuse

behold
david
and
solomon
truly
had
many
wives
andconcubines
which
thing
was
abominable

their
unbelief

their
hatred

of
the
iniquity

how
muchbetter

you

o

I
fear

sinsthat
their
skins
will
be
whiter
than
yours
when
ye
shall
bebrought
with

wherefore
a
commandment
I
give
unto
you
which
is
the
word
ofgod
that
ye
revile
no
more
against
them
because
of
the
darknessof
their
skins
neither
shall
ye
revile
against
them
because
oftheir
filthiness

ye
shall
remember
your
own
filthiness
andremember
that
their
filthiness
came
because
of
their
fathersjacob


wherefore
ye
shall
remember
your
children
how
that
ye
havegrieved
their
hearts
because
of
the
example
that
ye
have
setbefore
them
and
also
remember
that
ye
may
because
of
yourfilthiness
bring
your
children
unto
destruction
and
their
sinsbe
heaped
upon
your
heads
at
the
last
dayjacob


o
my
brethren
hearken
unto
my
words
arouse
the
faculties
ofyour
souls
shake
yourselves
that
ye
may
awake
from
the
slumberof
death
and
loose
yourselves
from
the
pains
of
hell
that
ye
maynot
become
angels
to
the
devil
to
be
cast
into
that
lake
of
fireand
brimstone
which
is
the
second
deathjacob

now
I

many
more
things
unto

ofnephi
warning
them
against
fornication
and
lasciviousness

kind
of

telling
them

jacob


now
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
I
jacob
having
ministeredmuch
unto
my
people
in
word
and
I
cannot
write
but
a
little
ofmy
words
because
of
the
difficulty
of
engraving
our
words
uponplates
and
we
know
that
the
things
which
we
write
upon
platesmust
remainjacob


but
whatsoever
things
we
write
upon
anything
save
it
be
uponplates
must
perish
and
vanish
away
but
we
can
write
a
few
wordsupon
plates
which
will
give
our
children
and
also
our
belovedbrethren
a
small
degree
of
knowledge
concerning
us
orconcerning
their
fathersjacob


now
in
this
thing
we
do
rejoice
and
we
labor
diligently
toengraven
these
words
upon
plates
hoping
that
our
belovedbrethren
and
our
children
will
receive
them
with
thankful
heartsand
look
upon
them
that
they
may
learn
with
joy
and
not
withsorrow
neither
with
contempt
concerning
their
first
parentsjacob


for
for
this
intent
have
we
written
these
things
that
theymay
know
that
we
knew
of
christ
and
we
had
a
hope
of
his
glorymany
hundred
years
before
his
coming
and
not
only
we
ourselveshad
a
hope
of
his
glory
but
also
all
the
holy
prophets
whichwere
before
usjacob


behold
they
believed
in
christ
and
worshiped
the
father
inhis
name
and
also
we
worship
the
father
in
his
name

and
forthis
intent
we
keep
the
law
of
moses
it
pointing
our
souls
tohim
and
for
this
cause
it
is
sanctified
unto
us
forrighteousness
even
as
it
was
accounted
unto
abraham
in
thewilderness
to
be
obedient
unto
the
commands
of
god
in
offering
uphis
son
Isaac
which
is
a
similitude
of
god
and
his
only
begottensonjacob


wherefore
we
search
the
prophets
and
we
have
manyrevelations
and
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
having
all
thesewitnesses
we
obtain
a
hope
and
our
faith
becometh
unshakeninsomuch
that
we
truly
can
command
in
the
name
of
jesus
and
thevery
trees
obey
us
or
the
mountains
or
the
waves
of
the
seajacob


nevertheless
the
lord
god
showeth
us
our
weakness
that
we
mayknow
that
it
is
by
his
grace
and
his
great
condescensions
untothe
children
of
men
that
we
have
power
to
do
these
thingsjacob


behold
great
and
marvelous
are
the
works
of
the
lord

howunsearchable
are
the
depths
of
the
mysteries
of
him
and
it
isimpossible
that
man
should
find
out
all
his
ways

and
no
manknoweth
of
his
ways
save
it
be
revealed
unto
him
whereforebrethren
despise
not
the
revelations
of
godjacob


for
behold
by
the
power
of
his
word
man
came
upon
the
face
ofthe
earth
which
earth
was
created
by
the
power
of
his
word
wherefore
if
god
being
able
to
speak
and
the
world
was
and
tospeak
and
man
was
created
o
then
why
not
able
to
command
theearth
or
the
workmanship
of
his
hands
upon
the
face
of
itaccording
to
his
will
and
pleasurejacob


wherefore
brethren
seek
not
to
counsel
the
lord
but
totake
counsel
from
his
hand

for
behold
ye
yourselves
know
thathe
counseleth
in
wisdom
and
in
justice
and
in
great
mercy
overall
his
worksjacob


wherefore
beloved
brethren
be
reconciled
unto
him
throughthe
atonement
of
christ
his
only
begotten
son
and
ye
may
obtaina
resurrection
according
to
the
power
of
the
resurrection
whichis
in
christ
and
be
presented
as
the
firstfruits
of
christ
untogod
having
faith
and
obtained
a
good
hope
of
glory
in
himbefore
he
manifesteth
himself
in
the
fleshjacob


and
now
beloved
marvel
not
that
I
tell
you
these
thingsfor
why
not
speak
of
the
atonement
of
christ
and
attain
to
aperfect
knowledge
of
him
as
to
attain
to
the
knowledge
of
aresurrection
and
the
world
to
comejacob


behold
my
brethren
he
that
prophesieth
let
him
prophesy
tothe
understanding
of
men
for
the
spirit
speaketh
the
truth
andlieth
not

wherefore
it
speaketh
of
things
as
they
really
areand
of
things
as
they
really
will
be
wherefore
these
things
aremanifested
unto
us
plainly
for
the
salvation
of
our
souls

butbehold
we
are
not
witnesses
alone
in
these
things
for
god
alsospake
them
unto
prophets
of
oldjacob


but
behold
the
jews
were
a
stiffnecked
people
and
theydespised
the
words
of
plainness
and
killed
the
prophets
andsought
for
things
that
they
could
not
understand

whereforebecause
of
their
blindness
which
blindness
came
by
lookingbeyond
the
mark
they
must
needs
fall
for
god
hath
taken
awayhis
plainness
from
them
and
delivered
unto
them
many
thingswhich
they
cannot
understand
because
they
desired
it

andbecause
they
desired
it
god
hath
done
it
that
they
may
stumblejacob


and
now
I
jacob
am
led
on
by
the
spirit
unto
prophesyingfor
I
perceive
by
the
workings
of
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
thatby
the
stumbling
of
the
jews
they
will
reject
the
stone
uponwhich
they
might
build
and
have
safe
foundationjacob


but
behold
according
to
the
scriptures
this
stone
shallbecome
the
great
and
the
last
and
the
only
sure
foundationupon
which
the
jews
can
buildjacob


and
now
my
beloved
how
is
it
possible
that
these
afterhaving
rejected
the
sure
foundation
can
ever
build
upon
it
thatit
may
become
the
head
of
their
cornerjacob


behold
my
beloved
brethren
I
will
unfold
this
mystery
untoyou
if
I
do
not
by
any
means
get
shaken
from

firmness

the

unto

the

profiteth
me
nothing

me
nothing
so
long

nevertheless
I
know
that

purpose
I

preserved

their
muchstrength
they

hitherto
brought

good

but
behold
the
wild

have
grown

have
overrun

because
that
the
wild

it
hath
brought

that

it
came
to

the

that

and
it

unto

I
have

behold
I
knew
that
all
the
fruit

now
these
which

thou
beheldest

I
also
cut
down

thou

that
a

they

now
behold
notwithstanding
all
the
care
which
we
havetaken
of
my

the
trees

have
become
corruptedthat
they
bring
forth
no
good

these
I
had
hoped
topreserve
to
have
laid
up
fruit
thereof
against
the
season
untomine
own

but
behold
they
have
become
like
unto

they
are
of
no
worth
but
to
be
hewn
down

it

but
what
could
I
have
done

in

have
Islackened
mine

I
have
not
nourished

nay
I
havenourished

I
have
digged
about

I
have
pruned

I
have
dunged

I
have
stretched
forth
mine

almostall
the
day
long

the
end
draweth

it
grieveth

I
should
hew
down

the

it

Isit
not

because

they
grew
fasterthan
the
strength
of

taking
strength
unto

behold
I
say
is
not
this
the
cause
that
the

have
become
corruptedjacob

it
came
to

that
the

said
untothe

let

go
to
and
hew
down
the
trees

I

what

havedone
more
for

behold
the

said
unto
the

it
a
little
longerjacob


and
the
lord
said
yea
I
will
spare
it
a
little
longer
forit
grieveth
me
that
I
should
lose
the
trees
of

wherefore
let
us
take
of
the
branches
of
these
which
I
haveplanted
in
the
nethermost
parts
of
my
vineyard
and
let
us
graftthem
into
the
tree
from
whence
they
came

let
us
pluck
fromthe
tree
those
branches
whose
fruit
is
most
bitter
and
graft
inthe
natural
branches
of
the

in
the

thereofjacob


and
this
will
I
do
that
the

may
not
perish

I
may
preserve
unto

the

thereof
for

purposejacob


and
behold
the
roots
of
the
natural
branches
of
the
treewhich
I
planted
whithersoever
I
would
are
yet
alive
whereforethat
I
may
preserve
them

for
mine
own

I
will
takeof
the
branches

I
will
graft

I
will
graft
in
unto
them
the

I
may
preserve
the

unto

whenthey
shall
be

strong
perhaps
they
may
bring
forthgood
fruit
unto
me
and
I
may
yet
have
glory
in
the
fruit
of
myvineyardjacob


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
from
the
natural
treewhich
had
become
wild

grafted

unto
the
natural

also
had
become
wildjacob

they
also
took
of
the
natural

the

it
be
those

will
pluck
from

this
I
do
that
perhaps
the

may
takestrength

of
their
goodness

because
of
the
change
ofthe
branches

the
good
may
overcome

that
I
have
grafted

he
labored
diligently
that
he
might
lead
away
the
heartsof
the
people
insomuch
that
he
did
lead
away
many
hearts
and
heknowing
that
I
jacob
had
faith
in
christ
who
should
come
hesought
much
opportunity
that
he
might
come
unto
mejacob


and
he
was
learned
that
he
had
a
perfect
knowledge
of
thelanguage
of
the
people
wherefore
he
could
use
much
flatteryand
much
power
of
speech
according
to
the
power
of
the
deviljacob


and
he
had
hope
to
shake
me
from
the
faith
notwithstandingthe
many
revelations
and
the
many
things
which
I
had
seenconcerning
these
things
for
I
truly
had
seen
angels
and
theyhad
ministered
unto
me

and
also
I
had
heard
the
voice
of
thelord
speaking
unto
me
in
very
word
from
time
to
time
whereforeI
could
not
be
shakenjacob


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
came
unto
me
and
on
this
wise
didhe
speak
unto
me
saying
brother
jacob
I
have
sought
muchopportunity
that
I
might
speak
unto
you
for
I
have
heard
andalso
know
that
thou
goest
about
much
preaching
that
which
yecall
the
gospel
or
the
doctrine
of
christjacob


and
ye
have
led
away
much
of
this
people
that
they
pervert
theright
way
of
god
and
keep
not
the
law
of
moses
which
is
theright
way
and
convert
the
law
of
moses
into
the
worship
of
abeing
which
ye
say
shall
come
many
hundred
years
hence

and
nowbehold
I
sherem
declare
unto
you
that
this
is
blasphemy
forno
man
knoweth
of
such
things
for
he
cannot
tell
of
things
tocome

and
after
this
manner
did
sherem
contend
against
mejacob


but
behold
the
lord
god
poured
in
his
spirit
into
my
soulinsomuch
that
I
did
confound
him
in
all
his
wordsjacob


and
I
said
unto
him
deniest
thou
the
christ
who
shall
come
and
he
said
If
there
should
be
a
christ
I
would
not
deny
himbut
I
know
that
there
is
no
christ
neither
has
been
nor
everwill
bejacob


and
I
said
unto
him
believest
thou
the
scriptures

and
hesaid
yeajacob


and
I
said
unto
him
then
ye
do
not
understand
them
for
theytruly
testify
of
christ

behold
I
say
unto
you
that
none
of
theprophets
have
written
nor
prophesied
save
they
have
spokenconcerning
this
christjacob


and
this
is
not
allit
has
been
made
manifest
unto
me
for
Ihave
heard
and
seen
and
it
also
has
been
made
manifest
unto
meby
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
wherefore
I
know
if
there
shouldbe
no
atonement
made
all
mankind
must
be
lostjacob


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
me
show
me
a
sign
bythis
power
of
the
holy
ghost
in
the
which
ye
know
so
muchjacob


and
I
said
unto
him
what
am
I
that
I
should
tempt
god
toshow
unto
thee
a
sign
in
the
thing
which
thou
knowest
to
be
trueyet
thou
wilt
deny
it
because
thou
art
of
the
devil
nevertheless
not
my
will
be
done
but
if
god
shall
smite
theelet
that
be
a
sign
unto
thee
that
he
has
power
both
in
heavenand
in
earth
and
also
that
christ
shall
come

and
thy
will
olord
be
done
and
not
minejacob


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
jacob
had
spoken
thesewords
the
power
of
the
lord
came
upon
him
insomuch
that
he
fellto
the
earth

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
nourished
for
thespace
of
many
daysjacob


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
the
people
gathertogether
on
the
morrow
for
I
shall
die
wherefore
I
desire
tospeak
unto
the
people
before
I
shall
diejacob


and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
the
multitude
weregathered
together
and
he
spake
plainly
unto
them
and
denied
thethings
which
he
had
taught
them
and
confessed
the
christ
andthe
power
of
the
holy
ghost
and
the
ministering
of
angelsjacob


and
he
spake
plainly
unto
them
that
he
had
been
deceived
bythe
power
of
the
devil

and
he
spake
of
hell
and
of
eternityand
of
eternal
punishmentjacob


and
he
said
I
fear
lest
I
have
committed
the
unpardonablesin
for
I
have
lied
unto
god
for
I
denied
the
christ
and
saidthat
I
believed
the
scriptures
and
they
truly
testify
of
him
and
because
I
have
thus
lied
unto
god
I
greatly
fear
lest
my
caseshall
be
awful
but
I
confess
unto
godjacob


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
said
these
words
hecould
say
no
more
and
he
gave
up
the
ghostjacob


and
when
the
multitude
had
witnessed
that
he
spake
thesethings
as
he
was
about
to
give
up
the
ghost
they
were
astonishedexceedingly
insomuch
that
the
power
of
god
came
down
upon
themand
they
were
overcome
that
they
fell
to
the
earthjacob


now
this
thing
was
pleasing
unto
me
jacob
for
I
hadrequested
it
of
my
father
who
was
in
heaven
for
he
had
heard
mycry
and
answered
my
prayerjacob


and
it
came
to
pass
that
peace
and
the
love
of
god
wasrestored
again
among
the
people
and
they
searched
thescriptures
and
hearkened
no
more
to
the
words
of
this
wickedmanjacob


and
it
came
to
pass
that
many
means
were
devised
to
reclaimand
restore
the
lamanites
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
but
itall
was
vain
for
they
delighted
in
wars
and
bloodshed
and
theyhad
an
eternal
hatred
against
us
their
brethren

and
theysought
by
the
power
of
their
arms
to
destroy
us
continuallyjacob


wherefore
the
people
of
nephi
did
fortify
against
them
withtheir
arms
and
with
all
their
might
trusting
in
the
god
androck
of
their
salvation
wherefore
they
became
as
yetconquerors
of
their
enemiesjacob


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
jacob
began
to
be
old
and
therecord
of
this
people
being
kept
on
the
other
plates
of
nephiwherefore
I
conclude
this
record
declaring
that
I
have
writtenaccording
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
by
saying
that
the
timepassed
away
with
us
and
also
our
lives
passed
away
like
as
itwere
unto
us
a
dream
we
being
a
lonesome
and
a
solemn
peoplewanderers
cast
out
from
jerusalem
born
in
tribulation
in
awilderness
and
hated
of
our
brethren
which
caused
wars
andcontentions
wherefore
we
did
mourn
out
our
daysjacob


and
I
jacob
saw
that
I
must
soon
go
down
to
my
gravewherefore
I
said
unto
my
son
enos
take
these
plates

and
Itold
him
the
things
which
my
brother
nephi
had
commanded
me
andhe
promised
obedience
unto
the
commands

and
I
make
an
end
of
mywriting
upon
these
plates
which
writing
has
been
small
and
tothe
reader
I
bid
farewell
hoping
that
many
of
my
brethren
mayread
my
words

brethren
adieuenos
the
book
of
enosenos


behold
it
came
to
pass
that
I
enos
knowing
my
father
thathe
was
a
just
manfor
he
taught
me
in
his
language
and
also
inthe
nurture
and
admonition
of
the
lordand
blessed
be
the
nameof
my
god
for
itenos


and
I
will
tell
you
of
the
wrestle
which
I
had
before
godbefore
I
received
a
remission
of
my
sinsenos


behold
I
went
to
hunt
beasts
in
the
forests
and
the
wordswhich
I
had
often
heard
my
father
speak
concerning
eternal
lifeand
the
joy
of
the
saints
sunk
deep
into
my
heartenos


and
my
soul
hungered
and
I
kneeled
down
before
my
maker
andI
cried
unto
him
in
mighty
prayer
and
supplication
for
mine
ownsoul
and
all
the
day
long
did
I
cry
unto
him
yea
and
when
thenight
came
I
did
still
raise
my
voice
high
that
it
reached
theheavensenos


and
there
came
a
voice
unto
me
saying
enos
thy
sins
areforgiven
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
blessedenos


and
I
enos
knew
that
god
could
not
lie
wherefore
my
guiltwas
swept
awayenos


and
I
said
lord
how
is
it
doneenos


and
he
said
unto
me
because
of
thy
faith
in
christ
whom
thouhast
never
before
heard
nor
seen

and
many
years
pass
awaybefore
he
shall
manifest
himself
in
the
flesh
wherefore
go
tothy
faith
hath
made
thee
wholeenos


now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
had
heard
these
words
I
beganto
feel
a
desire
for
the
welfare
of
my
brethren
the
nephiteswherefore
I
did
pour
out
my
whole
soul
unto
god
for
themenos


and
while
I
was
thus
struggling
in
the
spirit
behold
thevoice
of
the
lord
came
into
my
mind
again
saying
I
will
visitthy
brethren
according
to
their
diligence
in
keeping
mycommandments

I
have
given
unto
them
this
land
and
it
is
a
holyland
and
I
curse
it
not
save
it
be
for
the
cause
of
iniquitywherefore
I
will
visit
thy
brethren
according
as
I
have
saidand
their
transgressions
will
I
bring
down
with
sorrow
upon
theirown
headsenos


and
after
I
enos
had
heard
these
words
my
faith
began
tobe
unshaken
in
the
lord
and
I
prayed
unto
him
with
many
longstrugglings
for
my
brethren
the
lamanitesenos


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
had
prayed
and
labored
withall
diligence
the
lord
said
unto
me
I
will
grant
unto
theeaccording
to
thy
desires
because
of
thy
faithenos


and
now
behold
this
was
the
desire
which
I
desired
ofhimthat
if
it
should
so
be
that
my
people
the
nephitesshould
fall
into
transgression
and
by
any
means
be
destroyedand
the
lamanites
should
not
be
destroyed
that
the
lord
godwould
preserve
a
record
of
my
people
the
nephites
even
if
it
sobe
by
the
power
of
his
holy
arm
that
it
might
be
brought
forthat
some
future
day
unto
the
lamanites
that
perhaps
they
mightbe
brought
unto
salvationenos


for
at
the
present
our
strugglings
were
vain
in
restoringthem
to
the
true
faith

and
they
swore
in
their
wrath
that
ifit
were
possible
they
would
destroy
our
records
and
us
and
alsoall
the
traditions
of
our
fathersenos


wherefore
I
knowing
that
the
lord
god
was
able
to
preserveour
records
I
cried
unto
him
continually
for
he
had
said
untome
whatsoever
thing
ye
shall
ask
in
faith
believing
that
yeshall
receive
in
the
name
of
christ
ye
shall
receive
itenos


and
I
had
faith
and
I
did
cry
unto
god
that
he
wouldpreserve
the
records
and
he
covenanted
with
me
that
he
wouldbring
them
forth
unto
the
lamanites
in
his
own
due
timeenos


and
I
enos
knew
it
would
be
according
to
the
covenant
whichhe
had
made
wherefore
my
soul
did
restenos


and
the
lord
said
unto
me
thy
fathers
have
also
required
ofme
this
thing
and
it
shall
be
done
unto
them
according
to
theirfaith
for
their
faith
was
like
unto
thineenos


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
enos
went
about
among
thepeople
of
nephi
prophesying
of
things
to
come
and
testifying
ofthe
things
which
I
had
heard
and
seenenos


and
I
bear
record
that
the
people
of
nephi
did
seekdiligently
to
restore
the
lamanites
unto
the
true
faith
in
god
but
our
labors
were
vain
their
hatred
was
fixed
and
they
wereled
by
their
evil
nature
that
they
became
wild
and
ferociousand
a
bloodthirsty
people
full
of
idolatry
and
filthinessfeeding
upon
beasts
of
prey
dwelling
in
tents
and
wanderingabout
in
the
wilderness
with
a
short
skin
girdle
about
theirloins
and
their
heads
shaven
and
their
skill
was
in
the
bow
andin
the
cimeter
and
the
ax

and
many
of
them
did
eat
nothingsave
it
was
raw
meat
and
they
were
continually
seeking
todestroy
usenos


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
nephi
did
till
theland
and
raise
all
manner
of
grain
and
of
fruit
and
flocks
ofherds
and
flocks
of
all
manner
of
cattle
of
every
kind
andgoats
and
wild
goats
and
also
many
horsesenos


and
there
were
exceedingly
many
prophets
among
us

and
thepeople
were
a
stiffnecked
people
hard
to
understandenos


and
there
was
nothing
save
it
was
exceeding
harshnesspreaching
and
prophesying
of
wars
and
contentions
anddestructions
and
continually
reminding
them
of
death
and
theduration
of
eternity
and
the
judgments
and
the
power
of
god
andall
these
thingsstirring
them
up
continually
to
keep
them
inthe
fear
of
the
lord

I
say
there
was
nothing
short
of
thesethings
and
exceedingly
great
plainness
of
speech
would
keepthem
from
going
down
speedily
to
destruction

and
after
thismanner
do
I
write
concerning
themenos


and
I
saw
wars
between
the
nephites
and
lamanites
in
thecourse
of
my
daysenos


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
began
to
be
old
and
an
hundredand
seventy
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
from
the
time
that
ourfather
lehi
left
jerusalemenos


and
I
saw
that
I
must
soon
go
down
to
my
grave
having
beenwrought
upon
by
the
power
of
god
that
I
must
preach
and
prophesyunto
this
people
and
declare
the
word
according
to
the
truthwhich
is
in
christ

and
I
have
declared
it
in
all
my
days
andhave
rejoiced
in
it
above
that
of
the
worldenos


and
I
soon
go
to
the
place
of
my
rest
which
is
with
myredeemer
for
I
know
that
in
him
I
shall
rest

and
I
rejoice
inthe
day
when
my
mortal
shall
put
on
immortality
and
shall
standbefore
him
then
shall
I
see
his
face
with
pleasure
and
he
willsay
unto
me
come
unto
me
ye
blessed
there
is
a
place
preparedfor
you
in
the
mansions
of
my
father

amenjarom
the
book
of
jaromjarom


now
behold
I
jarom
write
a
few
words
according
to
thecommandment
of
my
father
enos
that
our
genealogy
may
be
keptjarom


and
as
these
plates
are
small
and
as
these
things
are
writtenfor
the
intent
of
the
benefit
of
our
brethren
the
lamaniteswherefore
it
must
needs
be
that
I
write
a
little
but
I
shallnot
write
the
things
of
my
prophesying
nor
of
my
revelations
for
what
could
I
write
more
than
my
fathers
have
written

forhave
not
they
revealed
the
plan
of
salvation

I
say
unto
youyea
and
this
sufficeth
mejarom


behold
it
is
expedient
that
much
should
be
done
among
thispeople
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
the
deafnessof
their
ears
and
the
blindness
of
their
minds
and
thestiffness
of
their
necks
nevertheless
god
is
exceedinglymerciful
unto
them
and
has
not
as
yet
swept
them
off
from
theface
of
the
landjarom


and
there
are
many
among
us
who
have
many
revelations
forthey
are
not
all
stiffnecked

and
as
many
as
are
not
stiffneckedand
have
faith
have
communion
with
the
holy
spirit

makethmanifest

and
now
behold
two
hundred
years
had
passed
away
and
thepeople
of
nephi
had
waxed
strong
in
the
land

they
observed
tokeep
the
law
of
moses
and
the
sabbath
day
holy
unto
the
lord
and
they
profaned
not
neither
did
they
blaspheme

and
the
lawsof
the
land
were
exceedingly
strictjarom


and
they
were
scattered
upon
much
of
the
face
of
the
land
andthe
lamanites
also

and
they
were
exceedingly
more
numerous
thanwere
they
of
the
nephites
and
they
loved
murder
and
would
drinkthe
blood
of
beastsjarom


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
many
times
against
us
thenephites
to
battle

but
our
kings
and
our
leaders
were
mightymen
in
the
faith
of
the
lord
and
they
taught
the
people
the
waysof
the
lord
wherefore
we
withstood
the
lamanites
and
swept
themaway
out
of
our
lands
and
began
to
fortify
our
cities
orwhatsoever
place
of
our
inheritancejarom


and
we
multiplied
exceedingly
and
spread
upon
the
face
of

became
exceedingly
rich
in
gold

in
silver

inprecious
things

being
warned
of

should
flee
out

aswould
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the

should
also
depart
outof
the
land
with
him
into
the
wildernessomni


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
according
as
the
lord
hadcommanded
him

and
they
departed
out
of
the
land
into
thewilderness
as
many
as
would
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
lordand
they
were
led
by
many
preachings
and
prophesyings

and
theywere
admonished
continually
by
the
word
of
god
and
they
were
ledby
the
power
of
his
arm
through
the
wilderness
until
they
camedown
into
the
land
which
is
called
the
land
of
zarahemlaomni


and
they
discovered
a
people
who
were
called
the
people
ofzarahemla

now
there
was
great
rejoicing
among
the
people
ofzarahemla
and
also
zarahemla
did
rejoice
exceedingly
becausethe
lord
had
sent
the
people
of
mosiah
with
the
plates
of
brasswhich
contained
the
record
of
the
jewsomni


behold
it
came
to
pass
that
mosiah
discovered
that
thepeople
of
zarahemla
came
out
from
jerusalem
at
the
time
thatzedekiah
king
of
judah
was
carried
away
captive
into
babylonomni


and
they
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
and
were
brought
by
thehand
of
the
lord
across
the
great
waters
into
the
land
wheremosiah
discovered
them
and
they
had
dwelt
there
from
that
timeforthomni


and
at
the
time
that
mosiah
discovered
them
they
had
becomeexceedingly
numerous

nevertheless
they
had
had
many
wars
andserious
contentions
and
had
fallen
by
the
sword
from
time
totime
and
their
language
had
become
corrupted
and
they
hadbrought
no
records
with
them
and
they
denied
the
being
of
theircreator
and
mosiah
nor
the
people
of
mosiah
could
understandthemomni


but
it
came
to
pass
that
mosiah
caused
that
they
should
betaught
in
his
language

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
weretaught
in
the
language
of
mosiah
zarahemla
gave
a
genealogy
ofhis
fathers
according
to
his
memory
and
they
are
written
butnot
in
these
platesomni


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
zarahemla
and
ofmosiah
did
unite
together
and
mosiah
was
appointed
to
be
theirkingomni


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
mosiah
there
was
a
largestone
brought
unto
him
with
engravings
on
it
and
he
didinterpret
the
engravings
by
the
gift
and
power
of
godomni


and
they
gave
an
account
of
one
coriantumr
and
the
slain
ofhis
people

and
coriantumr
was
discovered
by
the
people
ofzarahemla
and
he
dwelt
with
them
for
the
space
of
nine
moonsomni


It
also
spake
a
few
words
concerning
his
fathers

and
hisfirst
parents
came
out
from
the
tower
at
the
time
the
lordconfounded
the
language
of
the
people
and
the
severity
of
thelord
fell
upon
them
according
to
his
judgments
which
are
justand
their
bones
lay
scattered
in
the
land
northwardomni


behold
I
amaleki
was
born
in
the
days
of
mosiah
and
Ihave
lived
to
see
his
death
and
benjamin
his
son
reigneth
inhis
steadomni


and
behold
I
have
seen
in
the
days
of
king
benjamin
aserious
war
and
much
bloodshed
between
the
nephites
and
thelamanites

but
behold
the
nephites
did
obtain
much
advantageover
them
yea
insomuch
that
king
benjamin
did
drive
them
out
ofthe
land
of
zarahemlaomni


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
began
to
be
old
and
having
noseed
and
knowing
king
benjamin
to
be
a
just
man
before
the
lordwherefore
I
shall
deliver
up
these
plates
unto
him
exhortingall
men
to
come
unto
god
the
holy
one
of
Israel
and
believe
inprophesying
and
in
revelations
and
in
the
ministering
ofangels
and
in
the
gift
of
speaking
with
tongues
and
in
the
giftof
interpreting
languages
and
in
all
things
which
are
good
forthere
is
nothing
which
is
good
save
it
comes
from
the
lord
andthat
which
is
evil
cometh
from
the
devilomni


and
now
my
beloved
brethren
I
would
that
ye
should
comeunto
christ
who
is
the
holy
one
of
Israel
and
partake
of
hissalvation
and
the
power
of

and
endure

the
end
and
as
the
lordliveth
ye
will
be
savedomni


and
now
I
would
speak
somewhat
concerning
a
certain
numberwho
went
up
into
the
wilderness
to
return
to
the
land
of
nephifor
there
was
a
large
number
who
were
desirous
to
possess
theland
of
their
inheritanceomni


wherefore
they
went
up
into
the
wilderness

and
theirleader
being
a
strong
and
mighty
man
and
a
stiffnecked
manwherefore
he
caused
a
contention
among
them
and
they
were
allslain
save
fifty
in
the
wilderness
and
they
returned
again
tothe
land
of
zarahemlaomni


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
also
took
others
to
aconsiderable
number
and
took
their
journey
again
into
thewildernessomni


and
I
amaleki
had
a
brother
who
also
went
with
them
and
Ihave
not
since
known
concerning
them

and
I
am
about
to
lie
downin
my
grave
and
these
plates
are
full

and
I
make
an
end

mormon
the
words

and
now
I
mormon
being
about
to
deliver
up
the
record
whichI
have
been
making
into
the
hands
of
my
son
moroni
behold
I
havewitnessed
almost
all
the
destruction
of
my
people
the
nephiteswords
of
mormon


and
it
is
many
hundred
years
after
the
coming
of
christ
that
Ideliver
these
records
into
the
hands
of
my
son
and
it
supposethme
that
he
will
witness
the
entire
destruction
of
my
people

butmay
god
grant
that
he
may
survive
them
that
he
may
writesomewhat
concerning
them
and
somewhat
concerning
christ
thatperhaps
some
day
it
may
profit
themwords
of
mormon


and
now
I
speak
somewhat
concerning
that
which
I
havewritten
for
after
I
had
made
an
abridgment
from
the
plates
ofnephi
down
to
the
reign
of
this
king
benjamin
of
whom
amalekispake
I
searched
among
the
records
which
had
been
delivered
intomy
hands
and
I
found
these
plates
which
contained
this
smallaccount
of
the
prophets
from
jacob
down
to
the
reign
of
thisking
benjamin
and
also
many
of
the
words
of
nephiwords
of
mormon


and
the
things
which
are
upon
these
plates
pleasing
mebecause
of
the
prophecies
of
the
coming
of
christ
and
my
fathersknowing
that
many
of
them
have
been
fulfilled
yea
and
I
alsoknow
that
as
many
things
as
have
been
prophesied
concerning
usdown
to
this
day
have
been
fulfilled
and
as
many
as
go
beyondthis
day
must
surely
come
to
passwords
of
mormon


wherefore
I
chose
these
things
to
finish
my
record
uponthem
which
remainder
of
my
record
I
shall
take
from
the
platesof
nephi
and
I
cannot
write
the
hundredth
part
of
the
things
ofmy
peoplewords
of
mormon


but
behold
I
shall
take
these
plates
which
contain
theseprophesyings
and
revelations
and
put
them
with
the
remainder
ofmy
record
for
they
are
choice
unto
me
and
I
know
they
will
bechoice
unto
my
brethrenwords
of
mormon


and
I
do
this
for
a
wise
purpose
for
thus
it
whispereth
meaccording
to
the
workings
of
the
spirit
of
the
lord
which
is
inme

and
now
I
do
not
know
all
things
but
the
lord
knoweth
allthings
which
are
to
come
wherefore
he
worketh
in
me
to
doaccording
to
his
willwords
of
mormon


and
my
prayer
to
god
is
concerning
my
brethren
that
they
mayonce
again
come
to
the
knowledge
of
god
yea
the
redemption
ofchrist
that
they
may
once
again
be
a
delightsome
peoplewords
of
mormon


and
now
I
mormon
proceed
to
finish
out
my
record
which
Itake
from
the
plates
of
nephi
and
I
make
it
according
to
theknowledge
and
the
understanding
which
god
has
given
mewords
of
mormon


wherefore
it
came
to
pass
that
after
amaleki
had
deliveredup
these
plates
into
the
hands
of
king
benjamin
he
took
them
andput
them
with
the
other
plates
which
contained
records
which
hadbeen
handed
down
by
the
kings
from
generation
to
generationuntil
the
days
of
king
benjaminwords
of
mormon


and
they
were
handed
down
from
king
benjamin
from
generationto
generation
until
they
have
fallen
into
my
hands

and
Imormon
pray
to
god
that
they
may
be
preserved
from
this
timehenceforth

and
I
know
that
they
will
be
preserved
for
thereare
great
things
written
upon
them
out
of
which
my
people
andtheir
brethren
shall
be
judged
at
the
great
and
last
dayaccording
to
the
word
of
god
which
is
writtenwords
of
mormon


and
now
concerning
this
king
benjaminhe
had
somewhat
ofcontentions
among
his
own
peoplewords
of
mormon


and
it
came
to
pass
also
that
the
armies
of
the
lamanitescame
down
out
of
the
land
of
nephi
to
battle
against
his
peoplebut
behold
king
benjamin
gathered
together
his
armies
and
hedid
stand
against
them
and
he
did
fight
with
the
strength
of
hisown
arm
with
the
sword
of
labanwords
of
mormon


and
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
they
did
contend
againsttheir
enemies
until
they
had
slain
many
thousands
of
thelamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
contend
against
thelamanites
until
they
had
driven
them
out
of
all
the
lands
oftheir
inheritancewords
of
mormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
there
had
been
false

their
mouths
had
been
shut
and
they
punished
according
totheir
crimeswords
of
mormon


and
after
there
had
been
false
prophets
and
false
preachersand
teachers
among
the
people
and
all
these
having
been
punishedaccording
to
their
crimes
and
after
there
having
been
muchcontention
and
many
dissensions
away
unto
the
lamanites
beholdit
came
to
pass
that
king
benjamin
with
the
assistance
of
theholy
prophets
who
were
among
his
peoplewords
of
mormon


for
behold
king
benjamin
was
a
holy
man
and
he
did
reignover
his
people
in
righteousness
and
there
were
many
holy
men
inthe
land
and
they
did
speak
the
word
of
god
with
power
and
withauthority
and
they
did
use
much
sharpness
because
of
thestiffneckedness
of
the
peoplewords
of
mormon


wherefore
with
the
help
of
these
king
benjamin
by
laboringwith
all
the
might
of
his
body
and
the
faculty
of
his
whole
souland
also
the
prophets
did
once
more
establish
peace
in

and
now
there
was
no
more
contention
in
all
the
land
ofzarahemla
among
all
the
people
who
belonged
to
king
benjamin
sothat
king
benjamin
had
continual
peace
all
the
remainder
of
hisdaysmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
had
three
sons
and
he
calledtheir
names
mosiah
and
helorum
and
helaman

and
he
caused
thatthey
should
be
taught
in
all
the
language
of
his
fathers
thatthereby
they
might
become
men
of
understanding
and
that
theymight
know
concerning
the
prophecies
which
had
been
spoken
by
themouths
of
their
fathers
which
were
delivered
them
by
the
hand
ofthe
lordmosiah


and
he
also
taught
them
concerning
the
records
which
wereengraven
on
the
plates

brass
saying
my
sons
I
would
that
yeshould
remember
that
were
it
not
for
these

containthese
records
and
these
commandments
we
must
have
suffered
inignorance
even
at
this
present

not
knowing
the

for
it
were
not
possible
that
our

could
haveremembered
all
these
things
to
have
taught
them
to
his
childrenexcept
it
were
for
the
help
of
these
plates
for
he
having
beentaught
in
the
language
of
the
egyptians
therefore
he
could
readthese
engravings
and
teach
them
to
his
children
that
therebythey
could
teach
them
to
their
children
and
so
fulfilling
thecommandments
of
god
even
down
to
this
present
timemosiah


I
say
unto
you
my
sons
were
it
not
for
these
things
whichhave
been
kept
and
preserved
by
the
hand
of
god
that
we
mightread
and
understand
of
his
mysteries
and
have
his
commandmentsalways
before
our
eyes
that
even
our
fathers
would
have
dwindledin
unbelief
and
we
should
have
been
like
unto
our
brethren
thelamanites
who
know
nothing
concerning
these
things
or
even
donot
believe
them
when
they
are
taught
them
because
of
thetraditions
of
their
fathers
which
are
not
correctmosiah


o
my
sons
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
these
sayingsare
true
and
also
that
these
records
are
true

and
behold
alsothe
plates
of
nephi
which
contain
the
records
and
the
sayings
ofour
fathers
from
the
time
they
left
jerusalem
until
now
and
theyare
true
and
we
can
know
of
their
surety
because
we
have
thembefore
our
eyesmosiah


and
now
my
sons
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
to
searchthem
diligently
that
ye
may
profit
thereby
and
I
would
that
yeshould
keep
the
commandments
of
god
that
ye
may
prosper
in
theland
according
to
the
promises
which
the
lord
made
unto
ourfathersmosiah


and
many
more
things
did
king
benjamin
teach
his
sons
whichare
not
written
in
this
bookmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
king
benjamin
had
made
an
endof
teaching
his
sons
that
he
waxed
old
and
he
saw
that
he
mustvery
soon
go
the
way
of
all
the
earth
therefore
he
thought
itexpedient
that
he
should
confer
the
kingdom
upon
one
of
his
sonsmosiah


therefore
he
had
mosiah
brought
before
him
and
these
arethe
words
which
he
spake
unto
him
saying
my
son
I
would
thatye
should
make
a
proclamation
throughout
all
this
land
among
allthis
people
or
the
people
of
zarahemla
and
the
people
of
mosiahwho
dwell
in
the
land
that
thereby
they
may
be
gatheredtogether
for
on
the
morrow
I
shall
proclaim
unto
this
my
peopleout
of
mine
own
mouth
that
thou
art
a
king
and
a
ruler
over
thispeople
whom
the
lord
our
god
hath
given
usmosiah


and
moreover
I
shall
give
this
people
a
name
that
therebythey
may
be
distinguished
above
all
the
people
which
the
lord
godhath
brought
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
this
I
do
becausethey
have
been
a
diligent
people
in
keeping
the
commandments
ofthe
lordmosiah


and
I
give
unto
them
a
name
that
never
shall
be
blotted
outexcept
it
be
through
transgressionmosiah


yea
and
moreover
I
say
unto
you
that
if
this
highly
favoredpeople
of
the
lord
should
fall
into
transgression
and
become
awicked
and
an
adulterous
people
that
the
lord
will
deliver
themup
that
thereby
they
become
weak
like
unto
their
brethren
andhe
will
no
more
preserve
them
by
his
matchless
and
marvelouspower
as
he
has
hitherto
preserved
our
fathersmosiah


for
I
say
unto
you
that
if
he
had
not
extended
his
arm
inthe
preservation
of
our
fathers
they
must
have
fallen
into
thehands
of
the
lamanites
and
become
victims
to
their
hatredmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
king
benjamin
had
made
an
endof
these
sayings
to
his
son
that
he
gave
him
charge
concerningall
the
affairs
of
the
kingdommosiah


and
moreover
he
also
gave
him
charge
concerning
the
recordswhich
were
engraven
on
the
plates
of
brass
and
also
the
platesof
nephi
and
also
the
sword
of
laban
and
the
ball
or
directorwhich
led
our
fathers
through
the
wilderness
which
was
preparedby
the
hand
of
the
lord
that
thereby
they
might
be
led
every
oneaccording
to
the
heed
and
diligence
which
they
gave
unto
himmosiah


therefore
as
they
were
unfaithful
they
did
not
prosper
norprogress
in
their
journey
but
were
driven
back
and
incurred
thedispleasure
of
god
upon
them
and
therefore
they
were
smittenwith
famine
and
sore
afflictions
to
stir
them
up
in
remembranceof
their
dutymosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
mosiah
went
and
did
as
hisfather
had
commanded
him
and
proclaimed
unto
all
the
people
whowere
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
that
thereby
they
might
gatherthemselves
together
to
go
up
to
the
temple
to
hear
the
wordswhich
his
father
should
speak
unto
themmosiah
chapter
mosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
mosiah
had
done
as
his
fatherhad
commanded
him
and
had
made
a
proclamation
throughout
all
theland
that
the
people
gathered
themselves
together
throughout
allthe
land
that
they
might
go
up
to
the
temple
to
hear
the
wordswhich
king
benjamin
should
speak
unto
themmosiah


and
there
were
a
great
number
even
so
many
that
they
did
notnumber
them
for
they
had
multiplied
exceedingly
and
waxed
greatin
the
landmosiah


and
they
also
took
of
the
firstlings
of
their
flocks
thatthey
might
offer
sacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
according
to
thelaw
of
mosesmosiah


and
also
that
they
might
give
thanks
to
the
lord
their
godwho
had
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
who
haddelivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
and
hadappointed
just
men
to
be
their
teachers
and
also
a
just
man
tobe
their
king
who
had
established
peace
in
the
land
ofzarahemla
and
who
had
taught
them
to
keep
the
commandments
ofgod
that
they
might
rejoice
and
be
filled
with
love
towards
godand
all
menmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
came
up
to
the
temple
theypitched
their
tents
round
about
every
man
according
to
hisfamily
consisting
of
his
wife
and
his
sons
and
his
daughtersand
their
sons
and
their
daughters
from
the
eldest
down
to
theyoungest
every
family
being
separate
one
from
anothermosiah


and
they
pitched
their
tents
round
about
the
temple
every
manhaving
his
tent
with
the
door
thereof
towards
the
temple
thatthereby
they
might
remain
in
their
tents
and
hear
the
words
whichking
benjamin
should
speak
unto
themmosiah


for
the
multitude
being
so
great
that
king
benjamin
could
notteach
them
all
within
the
walls
of
the
temple
therefore
hecaused
a
tower
to
be
erected
that
thereby
his
people
might
hearthe
words
which
he
should
speak
unto
themmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
began
to
speak
to
his
people
fromthe
tower
and
they
could
not
all
hear
his
words
because
of
thegreatness
of
the
multitude
therefore
he
caused
that
the
wordswhich
he
spake
should
be
written
and
sent
forth
among
those
thatwere
not
under
the
sound
of
his
voice
that
they
might
alsoreceive
his
wordsmosiah


and
these
are
the
words
which
he
spake
and
caused
to
bewritten
saying
my
brethren
all
ye
that
have
assembledyourselves
together
you
that
can
hear
my
words
which
I
shallspeak
unto

this
day
for
I
have
not
commanded
you
to
come
uphither
to
trifle
with
the
words
which
I
shall
speak
but
that
youshould
hearken
unto
me
and
open
your
ears
that
ye
may
hear
andyour
hearts
that
ye
may
understand
and

that

of

may
be
unfolded

viewmosiah


I
have
not
commanded
you
to
come
up
hither
that
ye
shouldfear
me
or
that
ye
should
think
that
I
of
myself
am
more
than

manmosiah


but
I
am
like
as

subject
to
all
manner
ofinfirmities
in
body
and
mind
yet
I
have
been
chosen
by
thispeople
and
consecrated
by
my
father
and
was
suffered
by
thehand
of
the
lord
that
I
should
be
a
ruler
and
a
king
over
thispeople
and
have
been
kept
and
preserved
by
his
matchless
powerto
serve

with
all
the
might

and

and
even

labored
with

and
that
ye

not
be

andthat
there

which

grievous
to

of
all
these
things

I
have
not

but
I
tell

things
that

that
I
cananswer

clear
conscience
before

behold
I
say
unto

that
because
I
said
unto

that
Ihad

my
days
in
your
service
I
do
not
desire
to
boast
forI
have
only
been
in
the
service
of

and
behold
I
tell
you
these
things
that
ye
may
learn
wisdomthat
ye
may
learn
that
when

behold

and
behold
also
if
I

and
yet

kingmosiah


I
say
unto
you
my
brethren
that
if
you
should
render
allthe
thanks
and
praise
which
your
whole
soul
has
power
to
possessto
that
god
who

and
has
kept
and
preserved

has
caused
that
ye
should
rejoice
and
has
granted
that
yeshould
live
in
peace
one
with

I
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
should

who
has
createdyou
from
the
beginning
and
is
preserving

that
ye

and
even

moment
toanotherI
say
if
ye
should

with
all
your
whole
soulsyet
ye
would
be
unprofitable
servantsmosiah


and
behold
all
that
he
requires
of
you
is
to
keep
hiscommandments
and
he
has
promised
you
that
if
ye
would
keep
hiscommandments
ye
should
prosper
in
the
land
and
he
never
dothvary
from
that
which
he
hath
said
therefore
if
ye
do
keep
hiscommandments
he
doth
bless
you
and
prosper
youmosiah


and
now
in
the
first
place
he
hath
created
you
and
grantedunto
you
your
lives
for
which
ye
are
indebted
unto
himmosiah


and
secondly
he
doth
require
that
ye
should
do
as
he
hathcommanded
you
for
which
if
ye
do
he
doth
immediately
bless
youand
therefore
he
hath
paid
you

and
ye
are
still
indebted
untohim
and
are
and
will
be
forever
and
ever
therefore
of
whathave
ye
to
boastmosiah


and
now
I
ask
can
ye
say
aught
of
yourselves

I
answer
younay

ye
cannot
say
that
ye
are
even
as
much
as
the
dust
of
theearth
yet
ye
were
created
of
the
dust
of
the
earth
but
beholdit
belongeth
to
him
who
created
youmosiah


and
I
even
I
whom
ye
call
your
king
am
no
better
than
yeyourselves
are
for
I
am
also
of
the
dust

and
ye
behold
that
Iam
old
and
am
about
to
yield
up
this
mortal
frame
to
its
motherearthmosiah


therefore
as
I
said
unto
you
that
I
had
served
you
walkingwith
a
clear
conscience
before
god
even
so
I
at
this
time
havecaused
that
ye
should
assemble
yourselves
together
that
I
mightbe
found
blameless
and
that
your
blood
should
not
come
upon
mewhen
I
shall
stand
to
be
judged
of
god
of
the
things
whereof
hehath
commanded
me
concerning
youmosiah


I
say
unto
you
that
I
have
caused
that
ye
should
assembleyourselves
together
that
I
might
rid
my
garments
of
your
bloodat
this
period
of
time
when
I
am
about
to
go
down
to
my
gravethat
I
might
go
down
in
peace
and
my
immortal
spirit
may
jointhe
choirs
above
in
singing
the
praises
of
a
just
godmosiah


and
moreover
I
say
unto
you
that
I
have
caused
that
yeshould
assemble
yourselves
together
that
I
might
declare
untoyou
that
I
can
no
longer
be
your
teacher
nor
your
kingmosiah


for
even
at
this
time
my
whole
frame
doth
trembleexceedingly
while
attempting
to
speak
unto
you
but
the
lord
goddoth
support
me
and
hath
suffered
me
that
I
should
speak
untoyou
and
hath
commanded
me
that
I
should
declare
unto
you
thisday
that
my
son
mosiah
is
a
king
and
a
ruler
over
youmosiah


and
now
my
brethren
I
would
that
ye
should
do
as
ye
havehitherto
done

as
ye
have
kept
my
commandments
and
also
thecommandments
of
my
father
and
have
prospered
and
have
been
keptfrom
falling
into
the
hands
of
your
enemies
even
so
if
ye
shallkeep
the
commandments
of
my
son
or
the
commandments
of
god
whichshall
be
delivered
unto
you
by
him
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
landand
your
enemies
shall
have
no
power
over
youmosiah


but
o
my
people
beware
lest
there
shall
arise
contentionsamong
you
and
ye
list
to
obey
the
evil
spirit
which
was
spokenof
by
my
father
mosiahmosiah


for
behold
there
is
a
wo
pronounced
upon
him
who
listeth
toobey
that
spirit
for
if
he
listeth
to
obey
him
and
remainethand
dieth
in
his
sins
the
same
drinketh
damnation
to
his
ownsoul
for
he
receiveth
for
his
wages
an
everlasting
punishmenthaving
transgressed
the
law
of
god
contrary
to
his
own
knowledgemosiah


I
say
unto
you
that
there
are
not
any
among
you
except
itbe
your
little
children
that
have
not
been
taught
concerningthese
things
but
what
knoweth
that
ye
are
eternally
indebted
toyour
heavenly
father
to
render
to
him
all
that
you
have
and
areand
also
have
been
taught
concerning
the
records
which
containthe
prophecies
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
holy
prophets
evendown
to
the
time
our
father
lehi
left
jerusalemmosiah


and
also
all
that
has
been
spoken
by
our
fathers
until
now
and
behold
also
they
spake
that
which
was
commanded
them
of
thelord
therefore
they
are
just
and
truemosiah


and
now
I
say
unto
you
my
brethren
that
after
ye
haveknown
and
have
been
taught
all
these
things
if
ye
shouldtransgress
and
go
contrary
to
that
which
has
been
spoken
that
yedo
withdraw
yourselves
from
the
spirit
of
the
lord
that
it
mayhave
no
place
in
you
to
guide
you
in
wisdoms
paths
that
ye
maybe
blessed
prospered
and
preservedmosiah


I
say
unto
you
that
the
man
that
doeth
this
the
same
comethout
in
open
rebellion
against
god
therefore
he
listeth
to
obeythe
evil
spirit
and
becometh
an
enemy
to
all
righteousnesstherefore
the
lord
has
no
place
in
him
for
he
dwelleth
not
inunholy
templesmosiah


therefore
if
that
man
repenteth
not
and
remaineth
and
diethan
enemy
to
god
the
demands
of
divine
justice
do
awaken
hisimmortal
soul
to
a
lively
sense
of
his
own
guilt
which
dothcause
him
to
shrink
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
doth
fillhis
breast
with
guilt
and
pain
and
anguish
which
is
like
anunquenchable
fire
whose
flame
ascendeth
up
forever
and
evermosiah


and
now
I
say
unto
you
that
mercy
hath
no
claim
on
that
mantherefore
his
final
doom
is
to
endure
a
neverending
tormentmosiah


o
all
ye
old
men
and
also

and
he
shall
cast
out
devils
or
the
evil
spirits
which

hearts
of

and
lo
he
shall
suffer
temptations
and
pain
of
body
hungerthirst
and
fatigue
even
more
than
man
can
suffer
except
it
beunto
death
for
behold
blood
cometh
from
every
pore
so
greatshall
be
his
anguish
for
the
wickedness
and
the
abominations
ofhis
peoplemosiah


and
he
shall
be
called
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
thefather
of
heaven
and
earth
the
creator
of
all
things
from

and
his
mother
shall

and
lo
he
cometh
unto
his
own
that
salvation
might
come
untothe
children
of
men
even
through
faith
on
his
name
and
evenafter
all
this
they
shall
consider
him
a
man
and
say
that
hehath
a
devil
and
shall
scourge
him
and
shall
crucify
himmosiah


and
he
shall
rise
the
third
day
from
the
dead
and
behold
hestandeth
to
judge
the
world
and
behold
all
these
things
aredone
that
a
righteous
judgment
might
come
upon
the
children
ofmenmosiah


for
behold
and
also
his
blood
atoneth
for
the
sins
of
thosewho
have
fallen
by
the
transgression
of
adam
who
have
died
notknowing
the
will
of
god
concerning
them
or
who
have
ignorantlysinnedmosiah


but
wo
wo
unto
him
who
knoweth
that
he
rebelleth
againstgod

for
salvation
cometh
to
none
such
except
it
be
throughrepentance
and
faith
on
the
lord
jesus
christmosiah


and
the
lord
god
hath
sent
his
holy
prophets
among
all
thechildren
of
men
to
declare
these
things
to
every
kindrednation
and
tongue
that
thereby
whosoever
should
believe
thatchrist
should
come
the
same
might
receive
remission
of
theirsins
and
rejoice
with
exceedingly
great
joy
even
as
though
hehad
already
come
among
themmosiah


yet
the
lord
god
saw
that
his
people
were
a
stiffneckedpeople
and
he
appointed
unto
them
a
law
even
the
law
of
mosesmosiah


and
many
signs
and
wonders
and
types
and
shadows
showed
heunto
them
concerning
his
coming
and
also
holy
prophets
spakeunto
them
concerning
his
coming
and
yet
they
hardened
theirhearts
and
understood
not
that
the
law
of
moses
availeth
nothingexcept
it
were
through
the
atonement
of
his
bloodmosiah


and
even
if
it
were
possible
that
little
children
could
sinthey
could
not
be
saved
but
I
say
unto
you
they
are
blessed
forbehold
as
in
adam
or
by
nature
they
fall
even
so
the
blood
ofchrist
atoneth
for
their
sinsmosiah


and
moreover
I
say
unto
you
that
there
shall
be
no
othername
given
nor
any
other
way
nor
means
whereby
salvation
can
comeunto
the
children
of
men
only
in
and
through
the
name
of
christthe
lord
omnipotentmosiah


for
behold
he
judgeth
and
his
judgment
is
just
and
theinfant
perisheth
not
that
dieth
in
his
infancy
but
men
drinkdamnation
to
their
own
souls
except
they
humble
themselves
andbecome
as
little
children
and
believe
that
salvation
was
andis
and
is
to
come
in
and
through
the
atoning
blood
of
christthe
lord
omnipotentmosiah


for
the
natural
man
is
an
enemy
to
god
and
has
been
from
thefall
of
adam
and
will
be
forever
and
ever
unless
he
yields
tothe
enticings
of
the
holy
spirit
and
putteth
off
the
natural
manand
becometh
a
saint
through
the
atonement
of
christ
the
lordand
becometh
as
a
child
submissive
meek
humble
patient
fullof
love
willing
to
submit
to
all
things
which
the
lord
seeth
fitto
inflict
upon
him
even
as
a
child
doth
submit
to
his
fathermosiah


and
moreover
I
say
unto
you
that
the
time
shall
come
whenthe
knowledge
of
the
savior
shall
spread
throughout
every
nationkindred
tongue
and
peoplemosiah


and
behold
when
that
time
cometh
none
shall
be
foundblameless
before
god
except
it
be
little
children
only
throughrepentance
and
faith
on
the
name
of
the
lord
god
omnipotentmosiah


and
even
at
this
time
when
thou
shalt
have
taught
thy
peoplethe
things
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
commanded
thee
even
thenare
they
found
no
more
blameless
in
the
sight
of
god
onlyaccording
to
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
unto
theemosiah


and
now
I
have
spoken
the
words
which
the
lord
god
hathcommanded
memosiah


and
thus
saith
the
lord
they
shall
stand
as
a
brighttestimony
against
this
people
at
the
judgment
day
whereof
theyshall
be
judged
every
man
according
to
his
works
whether
theybe
good
or
whether
they
be
evilmosiah


and
if
they
be
evil
they
are
consigned
to
an
awful
view
oftheir
own
guilt
and
abominations
which
doth
cause
them
to
shrinkfrom
the
presence
of
the
lord
into
a
state
of
misery
and
endlesstorment
from
whence
they
can
no
more
return
therefore
they
havedrunk
damnation
to
their
own
soulsmosiah


therefore
they
have
drunk
out
of
the
cup
of
the
wrath
ofgod
which
justice
could
no
more
deny
unto
them
than
it
coulddeny
that
adam
should
fall
because
of
his
partaking
of
theforbidden
fruit
therefore
mercy
could
have
claim
on
them
nomore
forevermosiah


and
their
torment
is
as
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
whoseflames
are
unquenchable
and
whose
smoke
ascendeth
up
forever
andever

thus
hath
the
lord
commanded
me

amenmosiah
chapter
mosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
king
benjamin
had
made
anend
of
speaking
the
words
which
had
been
delivered
unto
him
bythe
angel
of
the
lord
that
he
cast
his
eyes
round
about
on
themultitude
and
behold
they
had
fallen
to
the
earth
for
the
fearof
the
lord
had
come
upon
themmosiah


and
they
had
viewed
themselves
in
their
own
carnal
state
evenless
than
the
dust
of
the
earth

and
they
all
cried
aloud
withone
voice
saying
o
have
mercy
and
apply
the
atoning
blood
ofchrist
that
we
may
receive
forgiveness
of
our
sins
and
ourhearts
may
be
purified
for
we
believe
in
jesus
christ
the
sonof
god
who
created
heaven
and
earth
and
all
things
who
shallcome
down
among
the
children
of
menmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
spoken
these
words
thespirit
of
the
lord
came
upon
them
and
they
were
filled
with
joyhaving
received
a
remission
of
their
sins
and
having
peace
ofconscience
because
of
the
exceeding
faith
which
they
had
injesus
christ
who
should
come
according
to
the
words
which
kingbenjamin
had
spoken
unto
themmosiah


and
king
benjamin
again
opened
his
mouth
and
began
to
speakunto
them
saying
my
friends
and
my
brethren
my
kindred
and
mypeople
I
would
again
call
your
attention
that
ye
may
hear
andunderstand
the
remainder
of
my
words
which
I
shall
speak
untoyoumosiah


for
behold
if
the
knowledge
of
the
goodness
of
god
at
thistime
has
awakened
you
to
a
sense
of
your
nothingness
and
yourworthless
and
fallen
statemosiah


I
say
unto
you
if
ye
have
come
to
a
knowledge
of
the
goodnessof
god
and
his
matchless
power
and
his
wisdom
and
hispatience
and
his
longsuffering
towards
the
children
of
men
andalso
the
atonement
which
has
been
prepared
from
the
foundationof
the
world
that
thereby
salvation
might
come
to
him
thatshould
put
his
trust
in
the
lord
and
should
be
diligent
inkeeping
his
commandments
and
continue
in
the
faith
even
unto
theend
of
his
life
I
mean
the
life
of
the
mortal
bodymosiah


I
say
that
this
is
the
man
who
receiveth
salvation
throughthe
atonement
which
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
worldfor
all
mankind
which
ever
were
since
the
fall
of
adam
or
whoare
or
who
ever
shall
be
even
unto
the
end
of
the
worldmosiah


and
this
is
the
means
whereby
salvation
cometh

and
there
isnone
other
salvation
save
this
which
hath
been
spoken
of
neitherare
there
any
conditions
whereby
man
can
be
saved
except
theconditions
which
I
have
told
youmosiah


believe
in
god
believe
that
he
is
and
that
he
created
allthings
both
in
heaven
and
in
earth
believe
that
he
has
allwisdom
and
all
power
both
in
heaven
and
in
earth
believe
thatman
doth
not
comprehend
all
the
things
which
the
lord
cancomprehendmosiah


and
again
believe
that
ye
must
repent
of
your
sins
andforsake
them
and
humble
yourselves
before
god
and
ask
insincerity
of
heart
that
he
would
forgive
you
and
now
if
youbelieve
all
these
things
see
that
ye
do
themmosiah


and
again
I
say
unto
you
as
I
have
said
before
that
as
yehave
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
god
or
if
ye
haveknown
of
his
goodness
and
have
tasted
of
his
love
and
havereceived
a
remission
of
your
sins
which
causeth
such
exceedinglygreat
joy
in
your
souls
even
so
I
would
that
ye
should
rememberand
always
retain
in
remembrance
the
greatness
of
god
and
yourown
nothingness
and
his
goodness
and
longsuffering
towards
youunworthy
creatures
and
humble
yourselves
even
in
the
depths
ofhumility
calling
on
the
name
of
the
lord
daily
and
standingsteadfastly
in
the
faith
of
that
which
is
to
come
which
wasspoken
by
the
mouth
of
the
angelmosiah


and
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
do
this
ye
shall
alwaysrejoice
and
be
filled
with
the
love
of
god
and
always
retain
aremission
of
your
sins
and
ye
shall
grow
in
the
knowledge
of
theglory
of
him
that
created
you
or
in
the
knowledge
of
that
whichis
just
and
truemosiah


and
ye
will
not
have
a
mind
to
injure
one
another
but
tolive
peaceably
and
to
render
to
every
man
according
to
thatwhich
is
his
duemosiah


and
ye
will
not
suffer
your
children
that
they
go
hungry
ornaked
neither
will
ye
suffer
that
they
transgress
the
laws
ofgod
and
fight
and
quarrel
one
with
another
and
serve
the
devilwho
is
the
master
of
sin
or
who
is
the
evil
spirit
which
hathbeen
spoken
of
by
our
fathers
he
being
an
enemy
to
allrighteousnessmosiah


but
ye
will
teach
them
to
walk
in
the
ways
of
truth
andsoberness
ye
will
teach
them
to
love
one
another
and
to
serveone
anothermosiah


and
also
ye
yourselves
will
succor
those
that
stand
in
needof
your
succor
ye
will
administer
of
your
substance
unto
himthat
standeth
in
need
and
ye
will
not
suffer
that
the
beggarputteth
up
his
petition
to
you
in
vain
and
turn
him
out
toperishmosiah


perhaps
thou
shalt
say
the
man
has
brought
upon
himself
hismisery
therefore
I
will
stay
my
hand
and
will
not
give
unto
himof
my
food
nor
impart
unto
him
of
my
substance
that
he
may
notsuffer
for
his
punishments
are
justmosiah


but
I
say
unto
you
o
man
whosoever
doeth
this
the
same
hathgreat
cause
to
repent
and
except
he
repenteth
of
that
which
hehath
done
he
perisheth
forever
and
hath
no
interest
in
thekingdom
of
godmosiah


for
behold
are
we
not
all
beggars

do
we
not
all
dependupon
the
same
being
even
god
for
all
the
substance
which
wehave
for
both
food
and
raiment
and
for
gold
and
for
silverand
for
all
the
riches
which
we
have
of
every
kindmosiah


and
behold
even
at
this
time
ye
have
been
calling
on
hisname
and
begging
for
a
remission
of
your
sins

and
has
hesuffered
that
ye
have
begged
in
vain

nay
he
has
poured
out
hisspirit
upon
you
and
has
caused
that
your
hearts
should
be
filledwith
joy
and
has
caused
that
your
mouths
should
be
stopped
thatye
could
not
find
utterance
so
exceedingly
great
was
your
joymosiah


and
now
if
god
who
has
created
you
on
whom
you
aredependent
for
your
lives
and
for
all
that
ye
have
and
are
dothgrant
unto
you
whatsoever
ye
ask
that
is
right
in
faithbelieving
that
ye
shall
receive
o
then
how
ye
ought
to
impartof
the
substance
that
ye
have
one
to
anothermosiah


and
if
ye
judge
the
man
who
putteth
up
his
petition
to
youfor
your
substance
that
he
perish
not
and
condemn
him
how
muchmore
just
will
be
your
condemnation
for
withholding
yoursubstance
which
doth
not
belong
to
you
but
to
god
to
whom
alsoyour
life
belongeth
and
yet
ye
put
up
no
petition
nor
repent
ofthe
thing
which
thou
hast
donemosiah


I
say
unto
you
wo
be
unto
that
man
for
his
substance
shallperish
with
him
and
now
I
say
these
things
unto
those
who
arerich
as
pertaining
to
the
things
of
this
worldmosiah


and
again
I
say
unto
the
poor
ye
who
have
not
and
yet
havesufficient
that
ye
remain
from
day
to
day
I
mean
all
you
whodeny
the
beggar
because
ye
have
not
I
would
that
ye
say
in
yourhearts
that
I
give
not
because
I
have
not
but
if
I
had
I
wouldgivemosiah


and
now
if
ye
say
this
in
your
hearts
ye
remain
guiltlessotherwise
ye
are
condemned
and
your
condemnation
is
just
for
yecovet
that
which
ye
have
not
receivedmosiah


and
now
for
the
sake
of
these
things
which
I
have
spokenunto
youthat
is
for
the
sake
of
retaining
a
remission
of
yoursins
from
day
to
day
that
ye
may
walk
guiltless
before
godIwould
that
ye
should
impart
of
your
substance
to
the
poor
everyman
according
to
that
which
he
hath
such
as
feeding
the
hungryclothing
the
naked
visiting
the
sick
and
administering
to
theirrelief
both
spiritually
and
temporally
according
to
theirwantsmosiah


and
see
that
all
these
things
are
done
in
wisdom
and
orderfor
it
is
not
requisite
that
a
man
should
run
faster
than
he
hasstrength

and
again
it
is
expedient
that
he
should
be
diligentthat
thereby
he
might
win
the
prize
therefore
all
things
mustbe
done
in
ordermosiah


and
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
whosoever
among
youborroweth
of
his
neighbor
should
return
the
thing
that
heborroweth
according
as
he
doth
agree
or
else
thou
shalt
commitsin
and
perhaps
thou
shalt
cause
thy
neighbor
to
commit
sinalsomosiah


and
finally
I
cannot
tell
you
all
the
things
whereby
ye
maycommit
sin
for
there
are
divers
ways
and
means
even
so
manythat
I
cannot
number
themmosiah


but
this
much
I
can
tell
you
that

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
king
benjamin
had
thusspoken
to
his
people
he
sent
among
them
desiring
to
know
of
hispeople
if
they
believed
the
words
which
he
had
spoken
unto
themmosiah


and
they
all
cried
with
one
voice
saying
yea
we
believe
allthe
words
which
thou
hast
spoken
unto
us
and
also
we
know
oftheir
surety
and
truth
because
of
the
spirit
of
the
lordomnipotent
which
has
wrought
a
mighty
change
in
us
or
in
ourhearts
that
we
have
no
more
disposition
to
do
evil
but
to
dogood
continuallymosiah


and
we
ourselves
also
through
the
infinite
goodness
of
godand
the
manifestations
of
his
spirit
have
great
views
of
thatwhich
is
to
come
and
were
it
expedient
we
could
prophesy
of
allthingsmosiah


and
it
is
the
faith
which
we
have
had
on
the
things
which
ourking
has
spoken
unto
us
that
has
brought
us
to
this
greatknowledge
whereby
we
do
rejoice
with
such
exceedingly
great
joymosiah


and
we
are
willing
to
enter
into
a
covenant
with
our
god
to
dohis
will
and
to
be
obedient
to
his
commandments
in
all
thingsthat
he
shall
command
us
all
the
remainder
of
our
days
that
wemay
not
bring
upon
ourselves
a
neverending
torment
as
has
beenspoken
by
the
angel
that
we
may
not
drink
out
of
the
cup
of
thewrath
of
godmosiah


and
now
these
are
the
words
which
king
benjamin
desired
ofthem
and
therefore
he
said
unto
them
ye
have
spoken
the
wordsthat
I
desired
and
the
covenant
which
ye
have
made
is
arighteous
covenantmosiah


and
now
because
of
the
covenant
which
ye
have
made
ye
shallbe
called
the
children
of
christ
his
sons
and
his
daughtersfor
behold
this
day
he
hath
spiritually
begotten
you
for
ye
saythat
your
hearts
are
changed
through
faith
on
his
nametherefore
ye
are
born
of
him
and
have
become
his
sons
and
hisdaughtersmosiah


and
under
this
head
ye
are
made
free
and
there
is
no
otherhead
whereby
ye
can
be
made
free

there
is
no
other
name
givenwhereby
salvation
cometh
therefore
I
would
that
ye
should
takeupon
you
the
name
of
christ
all
you
that
have
entered
into
thecovenant
with
god
that
ye
should
be
obedient
unto
the
end
of
yourlivesmosiah


and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
doeth
this
shall
befound
at
the
right
hand
of
god
for
he
shall
know
the
name
bywhich
he
is
called
for
he
shall
be
called
by
the
name
of
christmosiah


and
now
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
shall
not
takeupon
him
the
name
of
christ
must
be
called
by
some
other
nametherefore
he
findeth
himself
on
the
left
hand
of

and
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
also
that
this
is
thename
that
I
said
I
should
give
unto
you
that
never
should
beblotted
out
except
it
be
through
transgression
therefore
takeheed
that
ye
do
not
transgress
that
the
name
be
not
blotted
outof
your
heartsmosiah


I
say
unto
you
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
to
retain
thename
written
always
in
your
hearts
that
ye
are
not
found
on
theleft
hand
of

but
that
ye
hear
and
know
the
voice
by
which
yeshall
be
called
and
also
the
name
by
which
he
shall
call
youmosiah


for
how
knoweth
a
man
the
master
whom
he
has
not
served
andwho
is
a
stranger
unto
him
and
is
far
from
the
thoughts
andintents
of
his
heartmosiah


and
again
doth
a
man
take
an
ass
which
belongeth
to
hisneighbor
and
keep
him

I
say
unto
you
nay
he
will
not
evensuffer
that
he
shall
feed
among
his
flocks
but
will
drive
himaway
and
cast
him
out

I
say
unto
you
that
even
so
shall
it
beamong
you
if
ye
know

therefore
I

that

and
now
king
benjamin
thought
it
was
expedient
after
havingfinished
speaking
to
the
people
that
he
should
take
the
names
ofall
those
who
had
entered
into
a
covenant
with

to
keep
hiscommandmentsmosiah


and
it
came
to

that
there
was
not
one
soul
except
itwere
little
children
but
who
had
entered
into
the
covenant
andhad
taken
upon
them
the
name
of

and
again
it
came
to

that
when
king
benjamin
had
made
anend
of
all
these
things
and
had
consecrated
his
son
mosiah
to
bea
ruler
and
a
king
over
his
people
and
had
given
him
all
thecharges
concerning
the
kingdom
and
also
had
appointed
priests
toteach
the
people
that
thereby
they
might
hear
and
know
thecommandments
of
god
and
to
stir
them
up
in
remembrance
of
theoath
which
they
had
made
he
dismissed
the
multitude
and
theyreturned
every
one
according
to
their

and
mosiah
began
to
reign
in

and
he
beganto
reign
in
the
thirtieth

seventysix

and
king
benjamin
lived
three
years
and
he
diedmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
mosiah
did
walk
in
the
ways
ofthe
lord
and
did
observe
his
judgments
and
his
statutes
and
didkeep
his
commandments
in
all

whatsoever
he
commanded

and
king
mosiah
did
cause
his

that
they
should

he
also
himself
did
till

that
thereby

not

might

to
that
which
his

done
in

andthere
was
no
contention
among
all
his

for
the

ofthree
yearsmosiah
chapter
mosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
king
mosiah
had
hadcontinual
peace
for
the
space
of
three
years
he
was
desirous
toknow
concerning
the
people
who
went
up
to
dwell
in
the
land
oflehinephi
or
in
the
city
of
lehinephi
for
his
people
hadheard
nothing
from
them
from
the
time
they
left
the
land
ofzarahemla
therefore
they
wearied
him
with
their
teasingsmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
mosiah
granted
that
sixteen
oftheir
strong
men
might
go
up
to
the
land
of
lehinephi
to
inquireconcerning
their
brethrenmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
they
started
to
go
uphaving
with
them
one
ammon
he
being
a
strong
and
mighty
man
anda
descendant
of
zarahemla
and
he
was
also
their
leadermosiah


and
now
they
knew
not
the
course
they
should
travel
in
thewilderness
to
go
up
to
the
land
of
lehinephi
therefore
theywandered
many
days
in
the
wilderness
even
forty
days
did
theywandermosiah


and
when
they
had
wandered
forty
days
they
came
to
a
hillwhich
is
north
of
the
land
of
shilom
and
there
they
pitchedtheir
tentsmosiah


and
ammon
took
three
of
his
brethren
and
their
names
wereamaleki
helem
and
hem
and
they
went
down
into
the
land
ofnephimosiah


and
behold
they
met
the
king
of
the
people
who
were
in
theland
of
nephi
and
in
the
land
of
shilom
and
they
weresurrounded
by
the
kings
guard
and
were
taken
and
were
boundand
were
committed
to
prisonmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
been
in
prison
two
days
theywere
again
brought
before
the
king
and
their
bands
were
loosedand
they
stood
before
the
king
and
were
permitted
or
rathercommanded
that
they
should
answer
the
questions
which
he
shouldask
themmosiah


and
he
said
unto
them
behold
I
am
limhi
the
son
of
noahwho
was
the
son
of
zeniff
who
came
up
out
of
the
land
ofzarahemla
to
inherit
this
land
which
was
the
land
of
theirfathers
who
was
made
a
king
by
the
voice
of
the
peoplemosiah


and
now
I
desire
to
know
the
cause
whereby
ye
were
so
boldas
to
come
near
the
walls
of
the
city
when
I
myself
was
withmy
guards
without
the
gatemosiah


and
now
for
this
cause
have
I
suffered
that
ye
should
bepreserved
that
I
might
inquire
of
you
or
else
I
should
havecaused
that
my
guards
should
have
put
you
to
death

ye
arepermitted
to
speakmosiah


and
now
when
ammon
saw
that
he
was
permitted
to
speak
hewent
forth
and
bowed
himself
before
the
king
and
rising
again
hesaid
o
king
I
am
very
thankful
before
god
this
day
that
I
amyet
alive
and
am
permitted
to
speak
and
I
will
endeavor
tospeak
with
boldnessmosiah


for
I
am
assured
that
if
ye
had
known
me
ye
would
not
havesuffered
that
I
should
have
worn
these
bands

for
I
am
ammonand
am
a
descendant
of
zarahemla
and
have
come
up
out
of
theland
of
zarahemla
to
inquire
concerning
our
brethren
whom
zeniffbrought
up
out
of
that
landmosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
limhi
had
heard
the
wordsof
ammon
he
was
exceedingly
glad
and
said
now
I
know
of
asurety
that
my
brethren
who
were
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
are
yetalive

and
now
I
will
rejoice
and
on
the
morrow
I
will
causethat
my
people
shall
rejoice
alsomosiah


for
behold
we
are
in
bondage
to
the
lamanites
and
are
taxedwith
a
tax
which
is
grievous
to
be
borne

and
now
behold
ourbrethren
will
deliver
us
out
of
our
bondage
or
out
of
the
handsof
the
lamanites
and
we
will
be
their
slaves
for
it
is
betterthat
we
be
slaves
to
the
nephites
than
to
pay
tribute
to
the
kingof
the
lamanitesmosiah


and
now
king
limhi
commanded
his
guards
that
they
should
nomore
bind
ammon
nor
his
brethren
but
caused
that
they
should
goto
the
hill
which
was
north
of
shilom
and
bring
their
brethreninto
the
city
that
thereby
they
might
eat
and
drink
and
restthemselves
from
the
labors
of
their
journey
for
they
hadsuffered
many
things
they
had
suffered
hunger
thirst
andfatiguemosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
king
limhi
sent
aproclamation
among
all
his
people
that
thereby
they
might
gatherthemselves
together
to
the
temple
to
hear
the
words
which
heshould
speak
unto
themmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
gathered
themselvestogether
that
he
spake
unto
them
in
this
wise
saying
o
ye
mypeople
lift
up
your
heads
and
be
comforted
for
behold
the
timeis
at
hand
or
is
not
far
distant
when
we
shall
no
longer
be
insubjection
to
our
enemies
notwithstanding
our
many
strugglingswhich
have
been
in
vain
yet
I
trust
there
remaineth
an
effectualstruggle
to
be
mademosiah


therefore
lift
up
your
heads
and
rejoice
and
put
yourtrust
in
god
in
that
god
who
was
the
god
of
abraham
and
Isaacand
jacob
and
also
that
god
who
brought
the
children
of
Israelout
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
caused
that
they
should
walkthrough
the
red
sea
on
dry
ground
and
fed
them
with
manna
thatthey
might
not
perish
in
the
wilderness
and
many
more
things
didhe
do
for
themmosiah


and
again
that
same
god
has
brought
our
fathers
out
of
theland
of
jerusalem
and
has
kept
and
preserved
his
people
evenuntil
now
and
behold
it
is
because
of
our
iniquities
andabominations
that
he
has
brought
us
into
bondagemosiah


and
ye
all
are
witnesses
this
day
that
zeniff
who
was
madeking
over
this
people
he
being
overzealous
to
inherit
the
landof
his
fathers
therefore
being
deceived
by
the
cunning
andcraftiness
of
king
laman
who
having
entered
into
a
treaty
withking
zeniff
and
having
yielded
up
into
his
hands
the
possessionsof
a
part
of
the
land
or
even
the
city
of
lehinephi
and
thecity
of
shilom
and
the
land
round
aboutmosiah


and
all
this
he
did
for
the
sole
purpose
of
bringing
thispeople
into
subjection
or
into
bondage

and
behold
we
at
thistime
do
pay
tribute
to
the
king
of
the
lamanites
to
the
amountof
one
half
of
our
corn
and
our
barley
and
even
all
our
grainof
every
kind
and
one
half
of
the
increase
of
our
flocks
and
ourherds
and
even
one
half
of
all
we
have
or
possess
the
king
ofthe
lamanites
doth
exact
of
us
or
our
livesmosiah


and
now
is
not
this
grievous
to
be
borne

and
is
not
thisour
affliction
great

now
behold
how
great
reason
we
have
tomournmosiah


yea
I
say
unto
you
great
are
the
reasons
which
we
have
tomourn
for
behold
how
many
of
our
brethren
have
been
slain
andtheir
blood
has
been
spilt
in
vain
and
all
because
of
iniquitymosiah


for
if
this
people
had
not
fallen
into
transgression
the
lordwould
not
have
suffered
that
this
great
evil
should
come
uponthem

but
behold
they
would
not
hearken
unto
his
words
butthere
arose
contentions
among
them
even
so
much
that
they
didshed
blood
among
themselvesmosiah


and
a
prophet
of
the
lord
have
they
slain
yea
a
chosen
manof
god
who
told
them
of
their
wickedness
and
abominations
andprophesied
of
many
things
which
are
to
come
yea
even
the
comingof
christmosiah


and
because
he
said
unto
them
that
christ
was
the
god
thefather
of
all
things
and
said
that
he
should
take
upon
him
theimage
of
man
and
it
should
be
the
image
after
which
man
wascreated
in
the
beginning
or
in
other
words
he
said
that
man
wascreated
after
the
image
of
god
and
that
god
should
come
downamong
the
children
of
men
and
take
upon
him
flesh
and
blood
andgo
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
earthmosiah


and
now
because
he
said
this
they
did
put
him
to
death
andmany
more
things
did
they
do
which
brought
down
the
wrath
of
godupon
them

therefore
who
wondereth
that
they
are
in
bondageand
that
they
are
smitten
with
sore
afflictionsmosiah


for
behold
the
lord
hath
said
I
will
not
succor
my
peoplein
the
day
of
their
transgression
but
I
will
hedge
up
their
waysthat
they
prosper
not
and
their
doings
shall
be
as
a
stumblingblock
before
themmosiah


and
again
he
saith
If
my
people
shall
sow
filthiness
theyshall
reap
the
chaff
thereof
in
the
whirlwind
and
the
effectthereof

and
again
he
saith
If
my

shall
sow

reap

east

bringeth

destructionmosiah


and
now
behold
the
promise
of
the
lord
is
fulfilled
and
yeare
smitten
and
afflictedmosiah


but
if
ye
will
turn

put

and
serve

and
it
came
to

things
unto

told
hispeople
all

rehearse

the
people
ofking
limhi
so
that
they
might
understand
all
the
words
which
hespakemosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
done
all
this
that
kinglimhi
dismissed
the
multitude
and
caused
that
they
should
returnevery
one
unto
his
own
housemosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
caused
that
the
plates
whichcontained
the
record
of
his
people
from
the
time
that
they
leftthe
land
of
zarahemla
should
be
brought
before
ammon
that
hemight
read
themmosiah


now
as
soon
as
ammon
had
read
the
record
the
king
inquiredof
him
to
know
if
he
could
interpret
languages
and
ammon
toldhim
that
he
could
notmosiah


and
the
king
said
unto
him
being
grieved
for
the
afflictionsof
my
people
I
caused
that
forty
and
three
of
my
people
shouldtake
a
journey
into
the
wilderness
that
thereby
they
might
findthe
land
of
zarahemla
that
we
might
appeal
unto
our
brethren
todeliver
us
out
of
bondagemosiah


and
they
were
lost
in
the
wilderness
for
the
space
of
manydays
yet
they
were
diligent
and
found
not
the
land
of
zarahemlabut
returned
to
this
land
having
traveled
in
a
land
among
manywaters
having
discovered
a
land
which
was
covered
with
bones
ofmen
and
of
beasts
and
was
also
covered
with
ruins
of
buildingsof
every
kind
having
discovered
a
land
which
had
been
peopledwith
a
people
who
were
as
numerous
as
the
hosts
of
Israelmosiah


and
for
a
testimony
that
the
things
that
they
had
said
aretrue
they
have
brought
twentyfour
plates
which
are
filled
withengravings
and
they
are
of
pure
goldmosiah


and
behold
also
they
have
brought
breastplates
which
arelarge
and
they
are
of
brass
and
of
copper
and
are
perfectlysoundmosiah


and
again
they
have
brought
swords
the
hilts
thereof
haveperished
and
the
blades
thereof
were
cankered
with
rust
andthere
is
no
one
in
the
land
that
is
able
to
interpret
thelanguage
or
the
engravings
that
are
on
the
plates

therefore
Isaid
unto
thee
canst
thou
translatemosiah


and
I
say
unto
thee
again
knowest
thou
of
any
one
that
cantranslate

for
I
am
desirous
that
these
records
should
betranslated
into
our
language
for
perhaps
they
will
give
us
aknowledge
of
a
remnant
of
the
people
who
have
been
destroyedfrom
whence
these
records
came
or
perhaps
they
will
give
us
aknowledge
of
this
very
people
who
have
been
destroyed
and
I
amdesirous
to
know
the
cause
of
their
destructionmosiah


now
ammon
said
unto
him
I
can
assuredly
tell
thee
o
kingof
a
man
that
can
translate
the
records
for
he
has
wherewiththat
he
can
look
and
translate
all
records
that
are
of
ancientdate
and
it
is
a
gift
from
god

and
the
things
are
calledinterpreters
and
no
man
can
look
in
them
except
he
be
commandedlest
he
should
look
for
that
he
ought
not
and
he
should
perish
and
whosoever
is
commanded
to
look
in
them
the
same
is
calledseermosiah


and
behold
the
king
of
the
people
who
are
in
the
land
ofzarahemla
is
the
man
that
is
commanded
to
do
these
things
andwho
has
this
high
gift
from
godmosiah


and
the
king
said
that
a
seer
is
greater
than
a
prophetmosiah


and
ammon
said
that
a
seer
is
a
revelator
and
a
prophet
alsoand
a
gift
which
is
greater
can
no
man
have
except
he
shouldpossess
the
power
of
god
which
no
man
can
yet
a
man
may
havegreat
power
given
him
from
godmosiah


but
a
seer
can
know
of
things
which
are
past
and
also
ofthings
which
are
to
come
and
by
them
shall
all
things
berevealed
or
rather
shall
secret
things
be
made
manifest
andhidden
things
shall
come
to
light
and
things
which
are
not
knownshall
be
made
known
by
them
and
also
things
shall
be
made
knownby
them
which
otherwise
could
not
be
knownmosiah


thus
god
has
provided
a
means
that
man
through
faith
mightwork
mighty
miracles
therefore
he
becometh
a
great
benefit
tohis
fellow
beingsmosiah


and
now
when
ammon
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
these
wordsthe
king
rejoiced
exceedingly
and
gave
thanks
to
god
sayingdoubtless
a
great
mystery
is
contained
within
these
plates
andthese
interpreters
were
doubtless
prepared
for
the
purpose
ofunfolding
all
such
mysteries
to
the
children
of
menmosiah


o
how
marvelous
are
the
works
of
the
lord
and
how
long
dothhe
suffer
with
his
people
yea
and
how
blind
and
impenetrableare
the
understandings
of
the
children
of
men
for
they
will
notseek
wisdom
neither
do
they
desire
that
she
should
rule
overthemmosiah


yea
they
are
as
a
wild
flock

fleeth
from

scattereth

are
driven
and
are
devoured
by
the

I
zeniff
having
been
taught
in
all
the

and
having
had
a
knowledge
of
the
land
of
nephi
or
ofthe
land
of

and
having
been
sentas
a

among

that
I
might

when
Isaw
that
which
was
good
among

I
was
desirous
that
theyshould
not
be

therefore
I
contended
with
my
brethren
in
the
wilderness
forI
would
that
our
ruler
should
make
a
treaty
with
them
but
hebeing
an
austere
and
a
bloodthirsty
man
commanded
that
I
shouldbe
slain
but
I
was
rescued
by
the
shedding
of
much
blood
forfather
fought
against
father
and
brother
against
brother
untilthe
greater
number
of
our
army
was
destroyed
in
the
wildernessand
we
returned
those
of
us
that
were
spared
to
the
land
ofzarahemla
to
relate
that
tale
to
their
wives
and
their
childrenmosiah


and
yet
I
being
overzealous
to
inherit
the
land
of
ourfathers
collected
as
many
as
were
desirous
to
go
up
to
possessthe
land
and
started
again
on
our
journey
into
the
wilderness
togo
up
to
the
land
but
we
were
smitten
with
famine
and
soreafflictions
for
we
were
slow
to
remember
the
lord
our
godmosiah


nevertheless
after
many
days
wandering
in
the
wilderness
wepitched
our
tents
in
the
place
where
our
brethren
were
slainwhich
was
near
to
the
land
of
our
fathersmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
went
again
with
four
of
my
men
intothe
city
in
unto
the
king
that
I
might
know
of
the
dispositionof
the
king
and
that
I
might
know
if
I
might
go
in
with
mypeople
and
possess
the
land
in
peacemosiah


and
I
went
in
unto
the
king
and
he
covenanted
with
me
that
Imight
possess
the
land
of
lehinephi
and
the
land
of
shilommosiah


and
he
also
commanded
that
his
people
should
depart
out
of
theland
and
I
and
my
people
went
into
the
land
that
we
mightpossess
itmosiah


and
we
began
to
build
buildings
and
to
repair
the
walls
ofthe
city
yea
even
the
walls
of
the
city
of
lehinephi
and
thecity
of
shilommosiah


and
we
began
to
till
the
ground
yea
even
with
all
manner
ofseeds
with
seeds
of
corn
and
of
wheat
and
of
barley
and
withneas
and
with
sheum
and
with
seeds
of
all
manner
of
fruits
andwe
did
begin
to
multiply
and
prosper
in
the
landmosiah


now
it
was
the
cunning
and
the
craftiness
of
king
laman
tobring
my
people
into
bondage
that
he
yielded
up
the
land
that
wemight
possess

therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
dwelt
in
theland
for
the
space
of
twelve
years
that
king
laman
began
to
growuneasy
lest
by
any
means
my
people
should
wax
strong
in
theland
and
that
they
could
not
overpower
them
and
bring
them
intobondagemosiah


now
they
were
a
lazy
and
an
idolatrous
people
therefore
theywere
desirous
to
bring
us
into
bondage
that
they
might
glutthemselves
with
the
labors
of
our
hands
yea
that
they
mightfeast
themselves
upon
the
flocks
of
our
fieldsmosiah


therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
king
laman
began
to
stir
uphis
people
that
they
should
contend
with
my
people
thereforethere
began
to
be
wars
and
contentions
in

for
in
the
thirteenth
year
of
my
reign
in
the
land
of

on
the
south
of

land
of
shilom
when
my
people
werewatering
and
feeding
their

and
tilling

anumerous
host
of

came
upon
them
and
began
to
slay

to
take
off
their
flocks
and
the
corn

yea
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fled
all
that
were
notovertaken
even
into
the
city
of

and
did
call
upon
me
forprotectionmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
arm
them
with
bows
and
witharrows
with
swords
and
with

and
with
clubs
and
withslings
and
with
all

yea
in
the
strength
of

did
we
go
forth

I
and
my

did
cry
mightily
tothe
lord
that
he
would
deliver

out

we
were
awakened
to
a
remembrance

deliveranceof

and
god
did
hear
our
cries
and
did
answer
our
prayers
and
wedid
go
forth
in

yea
we
did
go
forth
against

and
in
one
day
and
a

we
did
slay

we
did
slay

had
driven

and
I
myself
with

and
it
came
to

that
we
again
began
to
establish

we
again
began
to
possess

and
Icaused
that
there
should
be

might
have
weapons
for

against
the
timethe

should
come
up
again
to

against

and
I
set
guards
round
about
the
land
that
the
lamanitesmight
not
come
upon
us
again
unawares
and
destroy
us
and
thus
Idid
guard
my
people
and
my
flocks
and
keep
them
from
fallinginto
the
hands
of

and
it
came
to

that
we
did
inherit
the
land
of
ourfathers
for
many
years
yea
for
the
space
of
twenty
and
twoyearsmosiah


and
I
did
cause
that
the

should
till

and
raiseall
manner

and
all
manner
of

of

and
I
did
cause

should
spin

and
work
all
manner
of
fine

and
cloth
of
everykind
that
we
might
clothe

thus
we
did
prosperin

we
did
have
continual
peace
in

for

and
two
yearsmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
laman
died
and
his
son
began
toreign
in
his
stead

and
he
began
to
stir
his
people
up
inrebellion
against
my
people
therefore
they
began
to
prepare
forwar
and
to
come
up
to
battle
against
my
peoplemosiah


but
I
had
sent
my
spies
out
round
about
the

I
might
discover
their
preparations
that
I
might
guardagainst
them
that
they
might
not
come

and
it
came
to

that
they
came
up
upon

north
of

with
their
numerous
hosts

armed
with

with

with

with

with

they
had
their
heads
shaved
thatthey
were
naked
and
they
were
girded
with
a
leathern
girdleabout
their
loinsmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
caused
that
the
women
and
childrenof
my
people
should
be
hid
in
the
wilderness
and
I
also
causedthat
all
my
old
men
that
could
bear
arms
and
also
all
my
youngmen
that
were
able
to
bear
arms
should
gather
themselvestogether
to
go
to
battle
against
the
lamanites
and
I
did
placethem
in
their
ranks
every
man
according
to
his
agemosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
go
up
to
battle
against
thelamanites
and
I
even
I
in
my
old
age
did
go
up
to
battleagainst
the
lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
go
up
inthe
strength
of
the
lord
to
battlemosiah


now
the
lamanites
knew
nothing
concerning
the
lord
nor
thestrength
of
the
lord
therefore
they
depended
upon
their
ownstrength

yet
they
were
a
strong
people
as
to
the
strength
ofmenmosiah


they
were
a
wild
and
ferocious
and
a
bloodthirsty
peoplebelieving
in
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
which
isthisbelieving
that
they
were
driven
out
of
the
land
ofjerusalem
because
of
the
iniquities
of
their
fathers
and
thatthey
were
wronged
in
the
wilderness
by
their
brethren
and
theywere
also
wronged
while
crossing
the
seamosiah


and
again
that
they
were
wronged
while
in
the
land
of
theirfirst
inheritance
after
they
had
crossed
the
sea
and
all
thisbecause
that
nephi
was
more
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandmentsof
the
lordtherefore
he
was
favored
of
the
lord
for
the
lordheard
his
prayers
and
answered
them
and
he
took
the
lead
oftheir
journey
in
the
wildernessmosiah


and
his
brethren
were
wroth
with
him
because
they
understoodnot
the
dealings
of
the
lord
they
were
also
wroth
with
him
uponthe
waters
because
they
hardened
their
hearts
against
the
lordmosiah


and
again
they
were
wroth
with
him
when
they
had
arrived
inthe
promised
land
because
they
said
that
he
had
taken
the
rulingof
the
people
out
of
their
hands
and
they
sought
to
kill
himmosiah


and
again
they
were
wroth
with
him
because
he
departed
intothe
wilderness
as
the
lord
had
commanded
him
and
took
therecords
which
were
engraven
on
the
plates
of
brass
for
they
saidthat
he
robbed
themmosiah


and
thus
they
have
taught
their
children
that
they
shouldhate
them
and
that
they
should
murder
them
and
that
they
shouldrob
and
plunder
them
and
do
all
they
could
to
destroy
themtherefore
they
have
an
eternal
hatred
towards
the
children
ofnephimosiah


for
this
very
cause
has
king
laman
by
his
cunning
and
lyingcraftiness
and
his
fair
promises
deceived
me
that
I
havebrought
this
my
people
up
into
this
land
that
they
may
destroythem
yea
and
we
have
suffered
these
many
years
in
the
landmosiah


and
now
I
zeniff
after
having
told
all
these
things
unto
mypeople
concerning
the
lamanites
I
did
stimulate
them
to
go
tobattle
with
their
might
putting
their
trust
in
the
lordtherefore
we
did
contend
with
them
face
to
facemosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
drive
them
again
out
of
ourland
and
we
slew
them
with
a
great
slaughter
even
so
many
thatwe
did
not
number

and
it
came
to

that
we
returned
again
to
our
own
landand
my
people
again
began
to
tend
their
flocks
and
to
till
theirgroundmosiah


and
now
I
being
old
did
confer
the
kingdom
upon

I

for

he

hedid
walk
after
the
desires

and
he
had

and
he
did
cause

do

which
was
abominable
in

yeaand
they
did

fifth
part
of
their
fatlings
and
also
a
fifth
partof
all
their
grainmosiah


and
all
this
did
he
take
to
support
himself
and
his
wives
andhis
concubines
and
also
his
priests
and
their
wives
and
theirconcubines
thus
he
had
changed
the
affairs
of
the
kingdommosiah


for
he
put
down
all
the
priests
that
had
been
consecrated
byhis
father
and
consecrated
new
ones
in
their
stead
such
as
werelifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
heartsmosiah


yea
and
thus
they
were
supported
in
their
laziness
and
intheir
idolatry
and
in
their
whoredoms
by
the
taxes
which
kingnoah
had
put
upon
his
people
thus
did
the
people
laborexceedingly
to
support
iniquitymosiah


yea
and
they
also
became
idolatrous
because
they
weredeceived
by
the
vain
and
flattering
words
of
the
king
andpriests
for
they
did
speak
flattering
things
unto
themmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
noah
built
many
elegant
andspacious
buildings
and
he
ornamented
them
with
fine
work
ofwood
and
of
all
manner
of
precious
things
of
gold
and
ofsilver
and
of
iron
and
of
brass
and
of
ziff
and
of
coppermosiah


and
he
also
built
him
a
spacious
palace
and
a
throne
in
themidst
thereof
all
of
which
was
of
fine
wood
and
was
ornamentedwith
gold
and
silver
and
with
precious
thingsmosiah


and
he
also
caused
that
his
workmen
should
work
all
manner
offine
work
within
the
walls
of
the
temple
of
fine
wood
and
ofcopper
and
of
brassmosiah


and
the
seats
which
were
set
apart
for
the
high
priestswhich
were
above
all
the
other
seats
he
did
ornament
with
puregold
and
he
caused
a
breastwork
to
be
built
before
them
thatthey
might
rest
their
bodies
and
their
arms
upon
while
theyshould
speak
lying
and
vain
words
to
his
peoplemosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
built
a
tower
near
the
templeyea
a
very
high
tower
even
so
high
that
he
could
stand
upon
thetop
thereof
and
overlook
the
land
of
shilom
and
also
the
land
ofshemlon
which
was
possessed
by
the
lamanites
and
he
could
evenlook
over
all
the
land
round
aboutmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
caused
many
buildings
to
be
builtin
the
land
shilom
and
he
caused
a
great
tower
to
be
built
onthe
hill
north
of
the
land
shilom
which
had
been
a
resort
forthe
children
of
nephi
at
the
time
they
fled
out
of
the
land
andthus
he
did
do
with
the
riches
which
he
obtained
by
the
taxationof
his
peoplemosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
placed
his
heart
upon
his
richesand
he
spent
his
time
in
riotous
living
with
his
wives
and
hisconcubines
and
so
did
also
his
priests
spend
their
time
withharlotsmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
planted
vineyards
round
about
inthe
land
and
he
built
winepresses
and
made
wine
in
abundanceand
therefore
he
became
a
winebibber
and
also
his
peoplemosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
began
to
come
in
uponhis
people
upon
small
numbers
and
to
slay
them
in
their
fieldsand
while
they
were
tending
their
flocksmosiah


and
king
noah
sent
guards
round
about
the
land
to
keep
themoff
but
he
did
not
send
a
sufficient
number
and
the
lamanitescame
upon
them
and
killed
them
and
drove
many
of
their
flocksout
of
the
land
thus
the
lamanites
began
to
destroy
them
and
toexercise
their
hatred
upon
themmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
noah
sent
his
armies
againstthem
and
they
were
driven
back
or
they
drove
them
back
for
atime
therefore
they
returned
rejoicing
in
their
spoilmosiah


and
now
because
of
this
great
victory
they
were
lifted
up
inthe
pride
of
their
hearts
they
did
boast
in
their
own
strengthsaying
that
their
fifty
could
stand
against
thousands
of
thelamanites
and
thus
they
did
boast
and
did
delight
in
blood
andthe
shedding
of
the
blood
of
their
brethren
and
this
because
ofthe
wickedness
of
their
king
and
priestsmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
a
man
among
them
whosename
was
abinadi
and
he
went
forth
among
them
and
began
toprophesy
saying

thussaith
the

and
thus
hath
he

now

came
to

that
when

they
were
wroth
with

and
sought
to

now
when

words
which
abinadi
hadspoken
unto

he
was
also
wroth
and
he
said

that
he

and
it
came
to

that
they
said
unto

may
question

and
the
king
commanded
that

and
they
began
to

him
that
they

thereby
they
might
have

heanswered

totheir
astonishment
for
he
did
withstand

and
did
confound

and
it
came
to

that
one
of

and
now
abinadi
said
unto

I

therefore
what

and
they
said

and
again
he
said
unto

If

why
do
ye
set

cause

know

not
that
I

yea
ye
know
that
Ispeak

and
you
ought
to
tremble
before
godmosiah


and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
ye
shall
be
smitten
for
youriniquities
for
ye
have
said
that
ye
teach
the

andwhat
know
ye
concerning
the
law
of

doth
salvation
come
bythe
law
of

what
say
yemosiah


and
they
answered
and
said
that
salvation
did
come
by
the
lawof
mosesmosiah


but
now
abinadi
said
unto
them
I
know
if
ye
keep
thecommandments
of

ye
shall
be
saved
yea
if
ye
keep
thecommandments
which
the

and
now
when
the
king
had
heard
these
words
he
said
unto
hispriests
away
with
this
fellow
and
slay
him
for
what
have

todo

for
he
is

and
they
stood
forth
and
attempted
to
lay
their
hands
on

he
withstood
them
and
said
unto
themmosiah


touch
me
not
for
god
shall
smite
you
if
ye
lay
your

me
for
I
have
not
delivered
the
message
which
the
lord
sentme
to
deliver
neither
have
I
told
you
that
which
ye
requestedthat
I
should
tell
therefore
god
will
not
suffer
that
I
shallbe
destroyed

but
I
must
fulfil
the
commandments
wherewith

has
commandedme
and
because
I
have
told

ye
are
angry
with
me
and
again
because
I
have
spoken
the
word
of

ye
have
judgedme
that
I
am

now
it
came
to
pass
after
abinadi
had
spoken
these
words
thatthe
people
of
king
noah
durst
not
lay
their
hands
on
him
for
thespirit
of
the
lord
was
upon
him
and
his
face
shone
withexceeding
luster
even
as
moses
did
while
in
the
mount
of
sinaiwhile
speaking
with
the
lordmosiah


and
he
spake
with
power
and
authority
from
god
and
hecontinued
his
words
sayingmosiah


ye
see
that
ye
have
not
power
to
slay
me
therefore
I
finishmy

and
I
perceive
that
it
cuts
you
to
your

I
tell
you
the

iniquitiesmosiah


yea
and
my
words
fill
you
with
wonder

withangermosiah


but
I
finish
my

and
then
it

not
whither
I
goif

so
be
that

but
this
much
I
tell

what
you
do
with

after
thisshall
be
as
a
type
and
a
shadow
of

and
now
I
read
unto
you
the
remainder
of
the
commandments
ofgod
for
I
perceive
that
they
are
not
written
in
your

Iperceive
that
ye
have
studied
and
taught
iniquity
the
most
partof
your

and
now
ye
remember
that
I
said
unto

thou

notmake

and
again
thou
shalt
not
bow
down
thyself
unto

them
for
I
the
lord
thy
god
am
a
jealous
god
visiting
theiniquities
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
unto
the
third
andfourth
generations
of
them
that
hate

and
showing
mercy
unto
thousands
of
them
that
love
me
andkeep
my

thou
shalt
not
take
the

of
the

not

remember
the

six

for
in

the

all
that
in

is
wherefore
the
lord

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
abinadi
had
made
an
end
ofthese
sayings
that
he
said
unto
them
have
ye
taught
this
peoplethat
they
should
observe
to
do
all
these
things
for
to
keep
thesecommandmentsmosiah


I
say
unto
you
nay
for
if
ye
had
the
lord
would
not
havecaused
me
to
come
forth
and
to
prophesy
evil
concerning
thispeoplemosiah


and
now
ye
have
said
that
salvation
cometh
by
the
law
ofmoses

I
say
unto
you
that
it
is
expedient
that
ye
should
keepthe
law
of
moses
as
yet
but
I
say
unto
you
that
the
time
shallcome
when
it
shall
no
more
be
expedient
to
keep
the
law
of
mosesmosiah


and
moreover
I
say
unto
you
that
salvation
doth
not
come
bythe
law
alone
and
were
it
not
for
the
atonement
which
godhimself
shall
make
for
the
sins
and
iniquities
of
his
peoplethat
they
must
unavoidably
perish
notwithstanding
the
law
ofmosesmosiah


and
now
I
say
unto
you
that
it
was
expedient
that
thereshould
be
a
law
given
to
the
children
of
Israel
yea
even
a
verystrict
law
for
they
were
a
stiffnecked
people
quick
to
doiniquity
and
slow
to
remember
the
lord
their
godmosiah


therefore
there
was
a
law
given
them
yea
a
law
ofperformances
and
of
ordinances
a
law
which
they
were
to
observestrictly
from
day
to
day
to
keep
them
in
remembrance
of
god
andtheir
duty
towards
himmosiah


but
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
all
these
things
were
typesof
things
to
comemosiah


and
now
did
they
understand
the
law

I
say
unto
you
naythey
did
not
all
understand
the
law
and
this
because
of
thehardness
of
their
hearts
for
they
understood
not
that
therecould
not
any
man
be
saved
except
it
were
through
the
redemptionof
godmosiah


for
behold
did
not
moses
prophesy
unto
them
concerning
thecoming
of
the
messiah
and
that
god
should
redeem
his
people
yea
and
even
all
the
prophets
who
have
prophesied
ever
since
theworld
beganhave
they
not
spoken
more
or
less
concerning
thesethingsmosiah


have
they
not
said
that
god
himself
should
come
down
amongthe
children
of
men
and
take
upon
him
the
form
of
man
and
goforth
in
mighty
power
upon
the
face
of
the
earthmosiah


yea
and
have
they
not
said
also
that
he
should
bring
to
passthe
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
that
he
himself
should
beoppressed
and
afflictedmosiah

yea
even
doth

Isaiah

to

for
he
shall
grow
up
before

as

as

he
hath
no
form

comeliness
and
whenwe
shall
see
him
there
is
no
beauty
that
we
should
desire
himmosiah


he
is
despised
and
rejected
of

a
man
of
sorrows
andacquainted
with
grief
and
we
hid
as
it
were
our
faces
from

was

we
esteemed

surely
he
has
borne

yetwe
did

but
he
was
wounded
for

he
was
bruised
forour
iniquities
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
andwith
his
stripes
we
are

all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
we
have
turned
every
oneto
his

way
and
the
lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
iniquities
ofus
allmosiah


he
was
oppressed
and
he
was
afflicted
yet
he
opened
not
hismouth
he
is
brought
as
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
and
as
a
sheepbefore
her
shearers
is
dumb
so
he
opened
not
his
mouthmosiah


he
was
taken
from
prison
and
from
judgment
and
who
shalldeclare
his
generation

for
he
was
cut
off
out
of
the
land
ofthe
living
for
the
transgressions
of
my
people
was
he
strickenmosiah


and
he
made
his
grave
with
the
wicked
and
with
the
rich
inhis
death
because
he
had
done
no
evil
neither
was
any
deceit
inhis

yet
it
pleased
the
lord
to
bruise
him
he
hath
put
him
togrief
when
thou
shalt
make
his

an
offering
for

therefore
will
I
divide
him
a
portion
with
the
great
and
heshall
divide
the
spoil
with

he
hath
pouredout

and
now
abinadi
said
unto

I
would
that
ye
shouldunderstand
that
god
himself
shall
come
down
among
the
children
ofmen

shall
redeem

and
because
he
dwelleth
in

he
shall
be
called
the
son
ofgod
and
having
subjected
the
flesh
to
the
will
of

the

the
father
because
he
was
conceived
by
the
power
of
god
andthe
son
because
of
the

thus
becoming
the
father
and
sonmosiah


and
they
are
one

yea
the
very
eternal

of

and
thus
the

the

being

suffereth

yieldethnot
to

suffereth
himself
to
be
mocked
andscourged

cast
out
and
disowned
by
his

and
after
all
this
after
working
many
mighty
miracles
amongthe
children
of

he
shall
be
led
yea
even
as
Isaiah
saidas
a
sheep
before
the
shearer
is
dumb
so
he
opened

even
so
he

thus

breaketh
the
bands

over

giving
the

and
now
I

behold
I

unto

that
when

now
what

behold
I

unto

that
whosoever

and
have
looked
forward
to
that
day
fora

I
say
unto

that
these

they
are

for
these
are

now
are

and
are

I
meanall
the

I

these

and
again
how

from

I

unto

this

for
o
howbeautiful
upon

are

that

that

yea
even
the

has
redeemed

yea
him
who
has
granted

for
were
it
not
for
the

which
he
hath
made
for

which
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of

Isay
unto
you
were
it
not
for
this
all
mankind
must
haveperishedmosiah


but
behold
the
bands
of
death
shall
be
broken
and
the
sonreigneth
and
hath
power
over
the

therefore
he
bringeth
topass
the
resurrection
of
the

and
there
cometh
a
resurrection
even
a
first

even
a
resurrection
of
those
that
have
been
and
who
areand
who
shall
be
even
until
the
resurrection
of

soshall
he
be
calledmosiah


and
now
the
resurrection
of
all
the
prophets
and
all
thosethat
have
believed
in
their
words
or
all
those
that
have
keptthe
commandments
of
god
shall
come
forth
in
the
firstresurrection
therefore
they
are
the
first
resurrectionmosiah


they
are
raised
to
dwell
with
god
who
has
redeemed
them
thusthey
have
eternal
life
through
christ
who
has
broken
the
bandsof
deathmosiah


and
these
are
those
who
have
part
in
the
first
resurrectionand
these
are
they
that
have
died
before
christ
came
in
theirignorance
not
having
salvation
declared
unto
them

and
thus
thelord
bringeth
about
the
restoration
of
these
and
they
have
apart
in
the
first
resurrection
or
have
eternal
life
beingredeemed
by
the
lordmosiah


and
little
children
also
have
eternal
lifemosiah


but
behold
and
fear
and
tremble
before
god
for
ye
ought
totremble
for
the
lord
redeemeth
none
such
that
rebel
against
himand
die
in
their
sins
yea
even
all
those
that
have
perished
intheir
sins
ever
since
the
world
began
that
have
wilfullyrebelled
against
god
that
have
known
the
commandments
of
godand
would
not
keep
them
these
are
they
that
have
no
part
in
thefirst
resurrectionmosiah


therefore
ought
ye
not
to
tremble

for
salvation
cometh
tonone
such
for
the
lord
hath
redeemed
none
such
yea
neither
canthe
lord
redeem
such
for
he
cannot
deny
himself
for
he
cannotdeny
justice
when
it
has
its
claimmosiah


and
now
I
say
unto
you
that
the
time
shall
come
that
thesalvation
of
the
lord
shall
be
declared
to
every
nation
kindredtongue
and
peoplemosiah


yea
lord
thy
watchmen
shall
lift

the

eyes
of
all

and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
ofour
godmosiah
chapter
mosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
abinadi
had
spoken
thesewords
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
said
the
time
shall
comewhen
all
shall
see
the
salvation
of
the
lord
when
every
nationkindred
tongue
and
people
shall
see
eye
to
eye
and
shallconfess
before
god
that
his
judgments
are
justmosiah


and
then
shall
the
wicked
be
cast
out
and
they
shall
havecause
to
howl
and
weep
and
wail
and
gnash
their
teeth
andthis
because
they
would
not
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
lordtherefore
the
lord
redeemeth
them
notmosiah


for
they
are
carnal
and
devilish
and
the
devil
has
power
overthem
yea
even
that
old
serpent
that
did
beguile
our
firstparents
which
was
the
cause
of
their
fall
which
was
the
causeof
all
mankind
becoming
carnal
sensual
devilish
knowing
evilfrom
good
subjecting
themselves
to
the
devilmosiah


thus
all
mankind
were
lost
and
behold
they
would
have
beenendlessly
lost
were
it
not
that
god
redeemed
his
people
fromtheir
lost
and
fallen
statemosiah


but
remember
that
he
that
persists
in
his
own
carnal
natureand
goes
on
in
the
ways
of
sin
and
rebellion
against
godremaineth
in
his
fallen
state
and
the
devil
hath
all
power
overhim

therefore
he
is
as
though
there
was
no
redemption
madebeing
an
enemy
to
god
and
also
is
the
devil
an
enemy
to
godmosiah


and
now
if
christ
had
not
come
into
the
world
speaking
ofthings
to
come
as
though
they
had
already
come
there
could
havebeen
no
redemptionmosiah


and
if
christ
had
not
risen
from
the
dead
or
have
broken
thebands
of
death
that
the
grave
should
have
no
victory
and
thatdeath
should
have
no
sting
there
could
have
been
noresurrectionmosiah


but
there
is
a
resurrection
therefore
the
grave
hath
novictory
and
the
sting
of
death
is
swallowed
up
in
christmosiah


he
is
the
light
and
the
life
of
the
world
yea
a
light
thatis
endless
that
can
never
be
darkened
yea
and
also
a
lifewhich
is
endless
that
there
can
be
no
more
deathmosiah


even
this
mortal
shall
put
on
immortality
and
thiscorruption
shall
put
on
incorruption
and
shall
be
brought
tostand
before
the
bar
of
god
to
be
judged
of
him
according
totheir
works
whether
they
be
good
or
whether
they
be
evilmosiah


If
they
be
good
to
the
resurrection
of
endless
life
andhappiness
and
if
they
be
evil
to
the
resurrection
of
endlessdamnation
being
delivered
up
to
the
devil
who
hath
subjectedthem
which
is
damnationmosiah


having
gone
according
to
their
own
carnal
wills
and
desireshaving
never
called
upon
the
lord
while
the
arms
of
mercy
wereextended
towards
them
for
the
arms
of
mercy
were
extendedtowards
them
and
they
would
not
they
being
warned
of
theiriniquities
and
yet
they
would
not
depart
from
them
and
they
werecommanded
to
repent
and
yet
they
would
not
repentmosiah


and
now
ought
ye
not
to
tremble
and
repent
of
your
sins
andremember
that
only
in
and
through
christ
ye
can
be
savedmosiah


therefore
if
ye
teach
the
law
of
moses
also
teach
that
itis
a
shadow
of
those
things
which
are
to
comemosiah


teach
them
that
redemption
cometh
through
christ
the
lordwho
is

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
abinadi
had
finished
thesesayings
that
the
king
commanded
that
the
priests
should
take
himand
cause
that
he
should
be
put
to
deathmosiah


but
there
was
one
among
them
whose
name
was
alma
he
alsobeing
a
descendant
of
nephi

and
he
was
a
young
man
and
hebelieved
the
words
which
abinadi
had
spoken
for
he
knewconcerning
the
iniquity
which
abinadi
has
testified
against
themtherefore
he
began
to
plead
with
the
king
that
he
would
not
beangry
with
abinadi
but
suffer
that
he
might
depart
in
peacemosiah


but
the
king
was
more
wroth
and
caused
that
alma
should
becast
out
from
among
them
and
sent
his
servants
after
him
thatthey
might
slay
himmosiah


but
he
fled
from
before
them
and
hid
himself
that
they
foundhim
not

and
he
being
concealed
for
many
days
did
write
all
thewords
which
abinadi
had
spokenmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
caused
that
his
guardsshould
surround
abinadi
and
take
him
and
they
bound
him
and
casthim
into
prisonmosiah


and
after
three
days
having
counseled
with
his
priests
hecaused
that
he
should
again
be
brought
before
himmosiah


and
he
said
unto
him
abinadi
we
have
found
an
accusationagainst
thee
and
thou
art
worthy
of
deathmosiah


for
thou
hast
said
that
god
himself
should
come
down
among
thechildren
of
men
and
now
for
this
cause
thou
shalt
be
put
todeath
unless
thou
wilt
recall
all
the
words
which
thou
hastspoken
evil
concerning
me
and
my
peoplemosiah


now
abinadi
said
unto
him
I
say
unto
you
I
will
not
recallthe
words
which
I
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
this
peoplefor
they
are
true
and
that
ye
may
know
of
their
surety
I
havesuffered
myself
that
I
have
fallen
into
your
handsmosiah


yea
and
I
will
suffer
even
until
death
and
I
will
notrecall
my
words
and
they
shall
stand
as
a
testimony
against
youand
if
ye
slay
me
ye
will
shed
innocent
blood
and
this
shallalso
stand
as
a
testimony
against
you
at
the
last
daymosiah


and
now
king
noah
was
about
to
release
him
for
he
feared
hisword
for
he
feared
that
the
judgments
of
god
would
come
uponhimmosiah


but
the
priests
lifted
up
their
voices
against
him
and
beganto
accuse
him
saying
he
has
reviled
the
king

therefore
theking
was
stirred
up
in
anger
against
him
and
he
delivered
him
upthat
he
might
be
slainmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
him
and
bound
him
andscourged
his
skin
with
faggots
yea
even
unto
deathmosiah


and
now
when
the
flames
began
to
scorch
him
he
cried
untothem
sayingmosiah


behold
even
as
ye
have
done
unto
me
so
shall
it
come
topass
that
thy
seed
shall
cause
that
many
shall
suffer
the
painsthat
I
do
suffer
even
the
pains
of
death
by
fire
and
thisbecause
they
believe
in
the
salvation
of
the
lord
their
godmosiah


and
it
will
come
to
pass
that
ye
shall
be
afflicted
with
allmanner
of
diseases
because
of
your
iniquitiesmosiah


yea
and
ye
shall
be
smitten
on
every
hand
and
shall
bedriven
and
scattered
to
and
fro
even
as
a
wild
flock
is
drivenby
wild
and
ferocious
beastsmosiah


and
in
that
day
ye
shall
be
hunted
and
ye
shall
be
taken
bythe
hand
of
your
enemies
and
then
ye
shall
suffer
as
I
sufferthe
pains
of
death
by
firemosiah


thus
god
executeth
vengeance
upon
those
that
destroy
hispeople

o
god
receive
my
soulmosiah


and
now
when
abinadi
had
said
these
words
he
fell
havingsuffered
death
by
fire
yea
having
been
put
to
death
because
hewould
not
deny
the
commandments
of
god
having
sealed
the
truthof
his
words
by
his
deathmosiah
chapter
mosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
who
had
fled
from
theservants
of
king
noah
repented
of
his
sins
and
iniquities
andwent
about
privately
among
the
people
and
began
to
teach
thewords
of
abinadimosiah


yea
concerning
that
which
was
to
come
and
also
concerningthe
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
the
redemption
of
the
peoplewhich
was
to
be
brought
to
pass
through
the
power
andsufferings
and
death
of
christ
and
his
resurrection
andascension
into
heavenmosiah


and
as
many
as
would
hear
his
word
he
did
teach

and
hetaught
them
privately
that
it
might
not
come
to
the
knowledge
ofthe
king

and
many
did
believe
his
wordsmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
many
as
did
believe
him
did
goforth
to
a
place
which
was
called
mormon
having
received
itsname
from
the
king
being
in
the
borders
of
the
land
having
beeninfested
by
times
or
at
seasons
by
wild
beastsmosiah


now
there
was
in
mormon
a
fountain
of
pure
water
and
almaresorted
thither
there
being
near
the
water
a
thicket
of
smalltrees
where
he
did
hide
himself
in
the
daytime
from
the
searchesof
the
kingmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
many
as
believed
him
went
thitherto
hear
his
wordsmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
after
many
days
there
were
a
goodly
numbergathered
together
at
the
place
of
mormon
to
hear
the
words
ofalma

yea
all
were
gathered
together
that
believed
on
his
wordto
hear
him

and
he
did
teach
them
and
did
preach
unto
themrepentance
and
redemption
and
faith
on
the
lordmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
them
behold
here
arethe
waters
of
mormon
for
thus
were
they
called
and
now
as
yeare
desirous
to
come
into
the
fold
of
god
and
to
be
called
hispeople
and
are
willing
to
bear
one
anothers
burdens
that
theymay
be
lightmosiah


yea
and
are
willing
to
mourn
with
those
that
mourn
yea
andcomfort
those
that
stand
in
need
of
comfort
and
to
stand
aswitnesses
of
god
at
all
times
and
in
all
things
and
in
allplaces
that
ye
may
be
in
even
until
death
that
ye
may
beredeemed
of
god
and
be
numbered
with
those
of
the
firstresurrection
that
ye
may
have
eternal
lifemosiah


now
I
say
unto
you
if
this
be
the
desire
of
your
heartswhat
have
you
against
being
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
lord
asa
witness
before
him
that
ye
have
entered
into
a
covenant
withhim
that
ye
will
serve
him
and
keep
his
commandments
that
hemay
pour
out
his
spirit
more
abundantly
upon
youmosiah


and
now
when
the
people
had
heard
these
words
they
clappedtheir
hands
for
joy
and
exclaimed
this
is
the
desire
of
ourheartsmosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
took
helam
he
being
one
ofthe
first
and
went
and
stood
forth
in
the
water
and
criedsaying
o
lord
pour
out
thy
spirit
upon
thy
servant
that
he
maydo
this
work
with
holiness
of
heartmosiah


and
when
he
had
said
these
words
the
spirit
of
the
lord
wasupon
him
and
he
said
helam
I
baptize
thee
having
authorityfrom
the
almighty
god
as
a
testimony
that
ye
have
entered
into
acovenant
to
serve
him
until
you
are
dead
as
to
the
mortal
bodyand
may
the
spirit
of
the
lord
be
poured
out
upon
you
and
may
hegrant
unto
you
eternal
life
through
the
redemption
of
christwhom
he
has
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
worldmosiah


and
after
alma
had
said
these
words
both
alma
and
helam
wereburied
in
the
water
and
they
arose
and
came
forth
out
of
thewater
rejoicing
being
filled
with
the
spiritmosiah


and
again
alma
took
another
and
went
forth
a
second
timeinto
the
water
and
baptized
him
according
to
the
first
only
hedid
not
bury
himself
again
in
the
watermosiah


and
after
this
manner
he
did
baptize
every
one
that
wentforth
to
the
place
of
mormon
and
they
were
in
number
about
twohundred
and
four
souls
yea
and
they
were
baptized
in
the
watersof
mormon
and
were
filled
with
the
grace
of
godmosiah


and
they
were
called
the
church
of
god
or
the
church
ofchrist
from
that
time
forward

and
it
came
to
pass
thatwhosoever
was
baptized
by
the
power
and
authority
of
god
wasadded
to
his
churchmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
having
authority
from
godordained
priests
even
one
priest
to
every
fifty
of
their
numberdid
he
ordain
to
preach
unto
them
and
to
teach
them
concerningthe
things
pertaining
to
the
kingdom
of
godmosiah


and
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
teach
nothing
save
itwere
the
things
which
he
had
taught
and
which
had
been
spoken
bythe
mouth
of
the
holy
prophetsmosiah


yea
even
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
preach
nothingsave
it
were
repentance
and
faith
on
the
lord
who
had
redeemedhis
peoplemosiah


and
he
commanded
them
that
there
should
be
no
contention
onewith
another
but
that
they
should
look
forward
with
one
eyehaving
one
faith
and
one
baptism
having
their
hearts
knittogether
in
unity
and
in
love
one
towards
anothermosiah


and
thus
he
commanded
them
to
preach

and
thus
they
becamethe
children
of
godmosiah


and
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
observe
the
sabbathday
and
keep
it
holy
and
also
every
day
they
should
give
thanksto
the
lord
their
godmosiah


and
he
also
commanded
them
that
the
priests
whom
he
hadordained
should
labor
with
their
own
hands
for
their
supportmosiah


and
there
was
one
day
in
every
week
that
was
set
apart
thatthey
should
gather
themselves
together
to
teach
the
people
andto
worship
the
lord
their
god
and
also
as
often
as
it
was
intheir
power
to
assemble
themselves
togethermosiah


and
the
priests
were
not
to
depend
upon
the
people
for
theirsupport
but
for
their
labor
they
were
to
receive
the
grace
ofgod
that
they
might
wax
strong
in
the
spirit
having
theknowledge
of
god
that
they
might
teach
with
power
and
authorityfrom
godmosiah


and
again
alma
commanded
that
the
people
of
the
church
shouldimpart
of
their
substance
every
one
according
to
that
which
hehad
if
he
have
more
abundantly
he
should
impart
more
abundantlyand
of
him
that
had
but
little
but
little
should
be
requiredand
to
him
that
had
not
should
be
givenmosiah


and
thus
they
should
impart
of
their
substance
of
their
ownfree
will
and
good
desires
towards
god
and
to
those
priests
thatstood
in
need
yea
and
to
every
needy
naked
soulmosiah


and
this
he
said
unto
them
having
been
commanded
of
god
andthey
did
walk
uprightly
before
god
imparting
to
one
another
bothtemporally
and
spiritually
according
to
their
needs
and
theirwantsmosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
all
this
was
done
in
mormonyea
by
the
waters
of
mormon
in
the
forest
that
was
near
thewaters
of

yea
the
place
of

how
beautiful
are
they
to

to
the
knowledge
of

yea
and
howblessed
are
they
for
they
shall
sing
to

and
these
things
were
done
in
the
borders
of
the
land
thatthey
might
not
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
kingmosiah


but
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
having
discovereda
movement
among
the
people
sent
his
servants
to
watch
them
therefore
on
the
day
that
they
were
assembling
themselvestogether
to
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
they
were
discovered
untothe
kingmosiah


and
now
the
king
said
that
alma
was
stirring
up
the
people
torebellion
against
him
therefore
he
sent
his
army
to
destroythemmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
and
the
people
of
the
lord
wereapprised
of
the
coming
of
the
kings
army
therefore
they
tooktheir
tents
and
their
families
and
departed
into
the
wildernessmosiah


and
they
were
in
number
about
four
hundred
and
fifty
soulsmosiah
chapter
mosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
army
of
the
king
returned
havingsearched
in
vain
for
the
people
of
the
lordmosiah


and
now
behold
the
forces
of
the
king
were
small
having
beenreduced
and
there
began
to
be
a
division
among
the
remainder
ofthe
peoplemosiah


and
the
lesser
part
began
to
breathe
out
threatenings
againstthe
king
and
there
began
to
be
a
great
contention
among
themmosiah


and
now
there
was
a
man
among
them
whose
name
was
gideon
andhe
being
a
strong
man
and
an
enemy
to
the
king
therefore
he
drewhis
sword
and
swore
in
his
wrath
that
he
would
slay
the
kingmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
fought
with
the
king
and
when
theking
saw
that
he
was
about
to
overpower
him
he
fled
and
ran
andgot
upon
the
tower
which
was
near
the
templemosiah


and
gideon
pursued
after
him
and
was
about
to
get
upon
thetower
to
slay
the
king
and
the
king
cast
his
eyes
round
abouttowards
the
land
of
shemlon
and
behold
the
army
of
thelamanites
were
within
the
borders
of
the
landmosiah


and
now
the
king
cried
out
in
the
anguish
of
his
soul
sayinggideon
spare
me
for
the
lamanites
are
upon
us
and
they
willdestroy
us
yea
they
will
destroy
my
peoplemosiah


and
now
the
king
was
not
so
much
concerned
about
his
people
ashe
was
about
his
own
life
nevertheless
gideon
did
spare
hislifemosiah


and
the
king
commanded
the
people
that
they
should
flee
beforethe
lamanites
and
he
himself
did
go
before
them
and
they
didflee
into
the
wilderness
with
their
women
and
their
childrenmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
pursue
them
anddid
overtake
them
and
began
to
slay
themmosiah


now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
commanded
them
that
all
themen
should
leave
their
wives
and
their
children
and
flee
beforethe
lamanitesmosiah


now
there
were
many
that
would
not
leave
them
but
had
ratherstay
and
perish
with
them

and
the
rest
left
their
wives
andtheir
children
and
fledmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
who
tarried
with
their
wivesand
their
children
caused
that
their
fair
daughters
should
standforth
and
plead
with
the
lamanites
that
they
would
not
slay
themmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
had
compassion
onthem
for
they
were
charmed
with
the
beauty
of
their
womenmosiah


therefore
the
lamanites
did
spare
their
lives
and
took
themcaptives
and
carried
them
back
to
the
land
of
nephi
and
grantedunto
them
that
they
might
possess
the
land
under
the
conditionsthat
they
would
deliver
up

into
the
hands
of
thelamanites
and
deliver
up
their
property
even
one
half
of
allthey
possessed
one
half
of
their
gold
and
their
silver
and
alltheir
precious
things
and
thus
they
should
pay
tribute
to
theking
of
the
lamanites
from
year
to
yearmosiah


and
now
there
was
one
of
the
sons
of
the
king
among
thosethat
were
taken
captive
whose
name
was
limhimosiah


and
now
limhi
was
desirous
that
his

should
not
bedestroyed
nevertheless
limhi
was
not
ignorant
of
the
iniquitiesof
his
father
he
himself
being
a
just
manmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
gideon
sent
men
into
the
wildernesssecretly
to
search
for
the
king
and
those
that
were
with
him
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
met
the
people
in
the
wildernessall
save
the
king
and
his
priestsmosiah


now
they
had
sworn
in
their
hearts
that
they
would
return
tothe
land
of

and
if

wives
and
their
children

and
also
those
that

tarried
with

that
they
wouldseek
revenge
and
also
perish
with

and
the
king
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
return
andthey
were
angry
with
the
king
and
caused
that
he
should
suffereven
unto

and
they
were
about
to
take
the
priests
also
and
put

and
they
fled
before

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
about
to
return
to
theland
of

and
they
met
the
men
of
gideon

and
the
men
ofgideon
told
them
of

and
now
the
priests
of
king
noah
being
ashamed
to
return
tothe
city
of

yea
and
also
fearing
that

therefore
they
durst
not

and
having

when

twenty

four
of

and
it
came
to

that
when
the
lamanites
found
that
theirdaughters
had
been
missing
they
were
angry
with
the
people
oflimhi
for
they
thought
it
was
the

therefore
they
sent
their

forth
yea
even
the

went
before

and
they
went
up
to

now
limhi
had
discovered

discover
therefore
he
gatheredhis

and
it

that
the

sorefor
they
fought

and
it
came

that
the

began
to
drivethe
lamanites
before

yet
they
were
not
half
so
numerous
asthe
lamanites

but
they
fought
for

for

for

therefore
they
exerted

did
they
fightmosiah


and
it
came
to

that
they
found

yet
he
was
not

having
beenwounded

left

so
speedy
was
the
flight

and
they
took

but
limhi
said
unto

ye

that
I
may
see
him

and
they
brought

and
limhisaid
unto

what
cause
have
ye
to
come
up
to
war
against

behold
my

have
not
broken
the
oath
that
I
madeunto

therefore
why
should
ye
break
the
oath
which
ye
madeunto
my
peoplemosiah


and
now
the
king
said
I
have
broken
the
oath
because
thypeople
did
carry
away
the
daughters
of
my
people
therefore
inmy
anger
I
did
cause
my
people
to
come
up
to
war
against
thypeoplemosiah


and
now
limhi
had
heard
nothing
concerning
this
mattertherefore
he
said
I
will
search
among
my
people
and
whosoeverhas
done
this
thing
shall
perish

therefore
he
caused
a
searchto
be
made
among
his

now
when
gideon
had
heard
these
things
he
being
the

he
went
forth
and
said
unto
the
king
I
pray
theeforbear
and
do
not
search
this
people
and
lay
not
this
thing
totheir
chargemosiah


for
do
ye
not
remember
the

whom
thispeople
sought
to
destroy

and
are
they
not
in
the
wilderness
and
are
not
they
the

who
have
stolen
the

and
now
behold
and
tell
the
king
of

things
that
hemay
tell

that
they
may
be

and
behold
they
come
with
their
numerous
hosts
and
exceptthe

doth
pacify

we
must
perishmosiah


for
are
not
the
words
of
abinadi
fulfilled
which
heprophesied
against
usand
all
this
because
we
would
not
hearkenunto
the
words
of
the
lord
and
turn
from
our
iniquitiesmosiah


and
now
let
us
pacify
the
king
and
we
fulfil
the
oath
whichwe
have
made
unto
him
for
it
is
better
that
we
should
be
inbondage
than
that
we
should
lose
our
lives
therefore
let
us
puta
stop
to
the
shedding
of
so
much
bloodmosiah


and
now
limhi
told
the
king
all
the
things
concerning
hisfather
and
the
priests
that
had
fled
into
the
wilderness
andattributed
the
carrying
away
of

and
it
came
to

that
the

was
pacified
towards
hispeople
and
he
said
unto
them
let
us
go
forth
to
meet
my

and
I
swear
unto
you
with
an
oath
that
my

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
followed
the
king
and
wentforth
without

lamanites

and
it
came
to

they
did
meet
the
lamanites
and
the
king
of
the
lamanitesdid
bow
himself
down
before
them
and
did
plead
in
behalf
of
thepeople

and
when
the
lamanites
saw
the
people
of
limhi
that
theywere
without

they
had
compassion
on
them
and
were
pacifiedtowards
them
and
returned
with

chapter
mosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
limhi
and
his
people
returned
to
thecity
of
nephi
and
began
to
dwell
in
the
land
again
in
peacemosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
many
days
the
lamanites
beganagain
to
be
stirred
up
in
anger
against
the
nephites
and
theybegan
to
come
into
the
borders
of
the
land
round
aboutmosiah


now
they
durst
not
slay
them
because
of
the
oath
which
theirking
had
made
unto
limhi
but
they
would
smite
them
on
theircheeks
and
exercise
authority
over
them
and
began
to
put
heavyburdens
upon
their
backs
and
drive
them
as
they
would
a
dumbassmosiah


yea
all
this
was
done
that
the
word
of
the
lord
might
befulfilledmosiah


and
now
the
afflictions
of
the
nephites
were
great
and
therewas
no
way
that
they
could
deliver
themselves
out
of
their
handsfor
the
lamanites
had
surrounded
them
on
every
sidemosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
began
to
murmur
with
theking
because
of
their
afflictions
and
they
began
to
be
desirousto
go
against
them
to
battle

and
they
did
afflict
the
kingsorely
with
their
complaints
therefore
he
granted
unto
them
thatthey
should
do
according
to
their
desiresmosiah


and
they
gathered
themselves
together
again
and
put
on
theirarmor
and
went
forth
against
the
lamanites
to
drive
them
out
oftheir
landmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
beat
them
anddrove
them
back
and
slew
many
of
themmosiah


and
now
there
was
a
great
mourning
and
lamentation
among
thepeople
of
limhi
the
widow
mourning
for
her
husband
the
son
andthe
daughter
mourning
for
their
father
and
the
brothers
fortheir
brethrenmosiah


now
there
were
a
great
many
widows
in
the
land
and
they
didcry
mightily
from
day
to
day
for
a
great
fear
of
the
lamaniteshad
come
upon
themmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
their
continual
cries
did
stir
upthe
remainder
of
the
people
of
limhi
to
anger
against
thelamanites
and
they
went
again
to
battle
but
they
were
drivenback
again
suffering
much
lossmosiah


yea
they
went
again
even
the
third
time
and
suffered
in
thelike
manner
and
those
that
were
not
slain
returned
again
to
thecity
of
nephimosiah


and
they
did
humble
themselves
even
to
the
dust
subjectingthemselves
to
the
yoke
of
bondage
submitting
themselves
to
besmitten
and
to
be
driven
to
and
fro
and
burdened
according
tothe
desires
of
their
enemiesmosiah


and
they
did
humble
themselves
even
in
the
depths
ofhumility
and
they
did
cry
mightily
to
god
yea
even
all
the
daylong
did
they
cry
unto
their
god
that
he
would
deliver
them
outof
their
afflictionsmosiah


and
now
the
lord
was
slow
to
hear
their
cry
because
of
theiriniquities
nevertheless
the
lord
did
hear
their
cries
and
beganto
soften
the
hearts
of
the
lamanites
that
they
began
to
easetheir
burdens
yet
the
lord
did
not
see
fit
to
deliver
them
outof
bondagemosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
prosper
by
degrees
inthe
land
and
began
to
raise
grain
more
abundantly
and
flocksand
herds
that
they
did
not
suffer
with
hungermosiah


now
there
was
a
great
number
of
women
more
than
there
was
ofmen
therefore
king
limhi
commanded
that
every
man
should
impartto
the
support
of
the
widows
and
their
children
that
they
mightnot
perish
with
hunger
and
this
they
did
because
of
thegreatness
of
their
number
that
had
been
slainmosiah


now
the
people
of
limhi
kept
together
in
a
body
as
much
as
itwas
possible
and
secured
their
grain
and
their
flocksmosiah


and
the
king
himself
did
not
trust
his
person
without
thewalls
of
the
city
unless
he
took
his
guards
with
him
fearingthat
he
might
by
some
means
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
lamanitesmosiah


and
he
caused
that
his
people
should
watch
the
land
roundabout
that
by
some
means
they
might
take
those
priests
that
fledinto
the
wilderness
who
had
stolen
the
daughters
of
thelamanites
and
that
had
caused
such
a
great
destruction
to
comeupon
themmosiah


for
they
were
desirous
to
take
them
that
they
might
punishthem
for
they
had
come
into
the
land
of
nephi
by
night
andcarried
off
their
grain
and
many
of
their
precious
thingstherefore
they
laid
wait
for
themmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
no
more
disturbancebetween
the
lamanites
and
the
people
of
limhi
even
until
thetime
that
ammon
and
his
brethren
came
into
the
landmosiah


and
the
king
having
been
without
the
gates
of
the
city
withhis
guard
discovered
ammon
and
his
brethren
and
supposing
themto
be
priests
of
noah
therefore
he
caused
that
they
should
betaken
and
bound
and
cast
into
prison

and
had
they
been
thepriests
of
noah
he
would
have
caused
that
they
should
be
put
todeathmosiah


but
when
he
found
that
they
were
not
but
that
they
were
hisbrethren
and
had
come
from
the
land
of
zarahemla
he
was
filledwith
exceedingly
great
joymosiah


now
king
limhi
had
sent
previous
to
the
coming
of
ammon
asmall
number
of
men
to
search
for
the
land
of
zarahemla
but
theycould
not
find
it
and
they
were
lost
in
the
wildernessmosiah


nevertheless
they
did
find
a
land
which
had
been
peopledyea
a
land
which
was
covered
with
dry
bones
yea
a
land
whichhad
been
peopled
and
which
had
been
destroyed
and
they
havingsupposed
it
to
be
the
land
of
zarahemla
returned
to
the
land
ofnephi
having
arrived
in
the
borders
of
the
land
not
many
daysbefore
the
coming
of
ammonmosiah


and
they
brought
a
record
with
them
even
a
record
of
thepeople
whose
bones
they
had
found
and
it
was
engraven
on
platesof
oremosiah


and
now
limhi
was
again
filled
with
joy
in
learning
from
themouth
of
ammon
that
king
mosiah
had
a
gift
from
god
whereby
hecould
interpret
such
engravings
yea
and
ammon
also
did
rejoicemosiah


yet
ammon
and
his
brethren
were
filled
with
sorrow
because
somany
of
their
brethren
had
been
slainmosiah


and
also
that
king
noah
and
his
priests
had
caused
the
peopleto
commit
so
many
sins
and
iniquities
against
god
and
they
alsodid
mourn
for
the
death
of
abinadi
and
also
for
the
departure
ofalma
and
the
people
that
went
with
him
who
had
formed
a
churchof
god
through
the
strength
and
power
of
god
and
faith
on
thewords
which
had
been
spoken
by
abinadimosiah


yea
they
did
mourn
for
their
departure
for
they
knew
notwhither
they
had
fled

now
they
would
have
gladly
joined
withthem
for
they
themselves
had
entered
into
a
covenant
with
god
toserve
him
and
keep
his
commandmentsmosiah


and
now
since
the
coming
of
ammon
king
limhi
had
alsoentered
into
a
covenant
with
god
and
also
many
of
his
people
toserve
him
and
keep
his
commandmentsmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
limhi
and
many
of
his
peoplewere
desirous
to
be
baptized
but
there
was
none
in
the
land
thathad
authority
from
god

and
ammon
declined
doing
this
thingconsidering
himself
an
unworthy
servantmosiah


therefore
they
did
not
at
that
time
form
themselves
into
achurch
waiting
upon
the
spirit
of
the
lord

now
they
weredesirous
to
become
even
as
alma
and
his
brethren
who
had
fledinto
the
wildernessmosiah


they
were
desirous
to
be
baptized
as
a
witness
and
atestimony
that
they
were
willing
to
serve
god
with
all
theirhearts
nevertheless
they
did
prolong
the
time
and
an
account
oftheir
baptism
shall
be
given
hereaftermosiah


and
now
all
the
study
of
ammon
and
his
people
and
king
limhiand
his
people
was
to
deliver
themselves
out
of
the
hands
of
thelamanites
and
from
bondagemosiah
chapter
mosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
and
king
limhi
began
toconsult
with
the
people
how
they
should
deliver
themselves
out
ofbondage
and
even
they
did
cause
that
all
the
people
shouldgather
themselves
together
and
this
they
did
that
they
mighthave
the
voice
of
the
people
concerning
the
mattermosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
could
find
no
way
to
deliverthemselves
out
of
bondage
except
it
were
to
take
their
women
andchildren
and
their
flocks
and
their
herds
and
their
tents
anddepart
into
the
wilderness
for
the
lamanites
being
so
numerousit
was
impossible
for
the
people
of
limhi
to
contend
with
themthinking
to
deliver
themselves
out
of
bondage
by
the
swordmosiah


now
it
came
to

that
gideon
went
forth
and
stood
beforethe

said
unto
him
now

and
now
o

not
found

to

or
if
thou
hast
hitherto
listened
to

I

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
hearkened
unto
the
words
ofgideonmosiah


and
king
limhi
caused
that
his
people

wine
as
a
present
unto

they
did
drink
freely
of
the
wine
which
king
limhi
did
sendunto

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
king
limhi
did
departby
night
into
the
wilderness
with
their
flocks
and
their
herdsand
they
went
round
about
the
land
of
shilom
in
the
wildernessand
bent
their
course
towards
the
land
of
zarahemla
being
led
byammon
and
his
brethrenmosiah


and
they
had
taken
all
their
gold
and
silver
and
theirprecious
things
which
they
could
carry
and
also
theirprovisions
with
them
into
the
wilderness
and
they
pursued
theirjourneymosiah


and
after
being
many
days
in
the
wilderness
they
arrived
inthe
land
of
zarahemla
and
joined
mosiahs
people
and
became
hissubjectsmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
mosiah
received
them
with
joy
andhe
also
received
their
records
and
also
the
records
which
hadbeen
found
by
the
people
of
limhimosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
when
the
lamanites
had
found
that
thepeople
of
limhi
had
departed
out
of
the
land
by
night
that
theysent
an
army
into
the
wilderness
to
pursue
themmosiah


and
after
they
had
pursued
them
two
days
they
could
nolonger
follow
their
tracks
therefore
they
were
lost
in
thewildernessmosiah
chapter
mosiah


now
alma
having
been
warned
of
the
lord
that
the
armies
ofking
noah
would
come
upon
them
and
having
made
it
known
to
hispeople
therefore
they
gathered
together
their
flocks
and
tookof
their
grain
and
departed
into
the
wilderness
before
thearmies
of
king
noahmosiah


and
the
lord
did
strengthen
them
that
the
people
of
king
noahcould
not
overtake
them
to
destroy
themmosiah


and
they
fled
eight
days
journey
into
the
wildernessmosiah


and
they
came
to
a
land
yea
even
a
very
beautiful
andpleasant
land
a
land
of
pure
watermosiah


and
they
pitched
their
tents
and
began
to
till
the
groundand
began
to
build
buildings
yea
they
were
industrious
and
didlabor
exceedinglymosiah


and
the
people
were
desirous
that
alma
should
be
their
kingfor
he
was
beloved
by
his
peoplemosiah


but
he
said
unto
them
behold
it
is
not
expedient
that
weshould
have
a
king
for
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
shall
not
esteemone
flesh
above
another
or
one
man
shall
not
think
himself
aboveanother
therefore
I
say
unto
you
it
is
not
expedient
that
yeshould
have
a
kingmosiah


nevertheless
if
it
were
possible
that
ye
could
always
havejust
men
to
be
your
kings
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
have
akingmosiah


but
remember
the
iniquity
of
king
noah
and
his
priests
and
Imyself
was
caught
in
a
snare
and
did
many
things
which
wereabominable
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
which
caused
me
sorerepentancemosiah


nevertheless
after
much
tribulation
the
lord
did
hear
mycries
and
did
answer
my
prayers
and
has
made
me
an
instrumentin
his
hands
in
bringing
so
many
of
you
to
a
knowledge
of
histruthmosiah


nevertheless
in
this
I
do
not
glory
for
I
am
unworthy
toglory
of
myselfmosiah


and
now
I
say
unto
you
ye
have
been
oppressed
by
king
noahand
have
been
in
bondage
to
him
and
his
priests
and
have
beenbrought
into
iniquity
by
them
therefore
ye
were
bound
with
thebands
of
iniquitymosiah


and
now
as
ye
have
been
delivered
by
the
power
of
god
out
ofthese
bonds
yea
even
out
of
the
hands
of
king
noah
and
hispeople
and
also
from
the
bonds
of
iniquity
even
so
I
desirethat
ye
should
stand
fast
in
this
liberty
wherewith
ye
have
beenmade
free
and
that
ye
trust
no
man
to
be
a
king
over
youmosiah


and
also
trust
no
one
to
be
your
teacher
nor
your
ministerexcept
he
be
a
man
of
god
walking
in
his
ways
and
keeping
hiscommandmentsmosiah


thus
did
alma
teach
his
people
that
every
man
should
lovehis
neighbor
as
himself
that
there
should
be
no
contention
amongthemmosiah


and
now
alma
was
their
high
priest
he
being
the
founder
oftheir
churchmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
none
received
authority
to
preach
orto
teach
except
it
were
by
him
from
god

therefore
heconsecrated
all
their
priests
and
all
their
teachers
and
nonewere
consecrated
except
they
were
just
menmosiah


therefore
they
did
watch
over
their
people
and
did
nourishthem
with
things
pertaining
to
righteousnessmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
prosper
exceedingly
inthe
land
and
they
called
the
land
helammosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
multiply
and
prosperexceedingly
in
the
land
of
helam
and
they
built
a
city
whichthey
called
the
city
of
helammosiah


nevertheless
the
lord
seeth
fit
to
chasten
his
people
yeahe
trieth
their
patience
and
their
faithmosiah


neverthelesswhosoever
putteth
his
trust
in
him
the
sameshall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day

yea
and
thus
it
was
withthis
peoplemosiah


for
behold
I
will
show
unto
you
that
they
were
brought
intobondage
and
none
could
deliver
them
but
the
lord
their
god
yeaeven
the
god
of
abraham
and
Isaac
and
of
jacobmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
deliver
them
and
he
did
showforth
his
mighty
power
unto
them
and
great
were
theirrejoicingsmosiah


for
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
while
they
were
in
the
landof
helam
yea
in
the
city
of
helam
while
tilling
the
land
roundabout
behold
an
army
of
the
lamanites
was
in
the
borders
of
thelandmosiah


now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brethren
of
alma
fled
from
theirfields
and
gathered
themselves
together
in
the
city
of
helamand
they
were
much
frightened
because
of
the
appearance
of
thelamanitesmosiah


but
alma
went
forth
and
stood
among
them
and
exhorted
themthat
they
should
not
be
frightened
but
that
they
should
rememberthe
lord
their
god
and
he
would
deliver
themmosiah


therefore
they
hushed
their
fears
and
began
to
cry
unto
thelord
that
he
would
soften
the
hearts
of
the
lamanites
that
theywould
spare
them
and
their
wives
and
their
childrenmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
the
the
lord
did
soften
the
hearts
of
thelamanites

and
alma
and
his
brethren
went
forth
and
deliveredthemselves
up
into
their
hands
and
the
lamanites
took
possessionof
the
land
of
helammosiah


now
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
which
had
followed
after
thepeople
of
king
limhi
had
been
lost
in
the
wilderness
for
manydaysmosiah


and
behold
they
had
found
those
priests
of
king
noah
in
aplace
which
they
called
amulon
and
they
had
begun
to
possess
theland
of
amulon
and
had
begun
to
till
the
groundmosiah


now
the
name
of
the
leader
of
those
priests
was
amulonmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
amulon
did
plead
with
the
lamanitesand
he
also
sent
forth
their
wives
who
were
the
daughters
of
thelamanites
to
plead
with
their
brethren
that
they
should
notdestroy
their
husbandsmosiah


and
the
lamanites
had
compassion
on
amulon
and
his
brethrenand
did
not
destroy
them
because
of
their
wivesmosiah


and
amulon
and
his
brethren
did
join
the
lamanites
and
theywere
traveling
in
the
wilderness
in
search
of
the
land
of
nephiwhen
they
discovered
the
land
of
helam
which
was
possessed
byalma
and
his
brethrenmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
promised
unto
alma
andhis
brethren
that
if
they
would
show
them
the
way
which
led
tothe
land
of
nephi
that
they
would
grant
unto
them
their
lives
andtheir
libertymosiah


but
after
alma
had
shown
them
the
way
that
led
to
the
land
ofnephi
the
lamanites
would
not
keep
their
promise
but
they
setguards
round
about
the
land
of
helam
over
alma
and
his
brethrenmosiah


and
the
remainder
of
them
went
to
the
land
of
nephi
and
apart
of
them
returned
to
the
land
of
helam
and
also
brought
withthem
the
wives
and
the
children
of
the
guards
who
had
been
leftin
the
landmosiah


and
the
king
of
the
lamanites
had
granted
unto
amulon
that
heshould
be
a
king
and
a
ruler
over
his
people
who
were
in
theland
of
helam
nevertheless
he
should
have
no
power
to
doanything
contrary
to
the
will
of
the
king
of
the
lamanitesmosiah
chapter
mosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
amulon
did
gain
favor
in
the
eyes
ofthe
king
of
the
lamanites
therefore
the
king
of
the
lamanitesgranted
unto
him
and
his
brethren
that
they
should
be
appointedteachers
over
his
people
yea
even
over
the
people
who
were
inthe
land
of
shemlon
and
in
the
land
of
shilom
and
in
the
landof
amulonmosiah


for
the
lamanites
had
taken
possession
of
all
these
landstherefore
the
king
of
the
lamanites
had
appointed
kings
over
allthese
landsmosiah


and
now
the
name
of
the
king
of
the
lamanites
was
laman
beingcalled
after
the
name
of
his
father
and
therefore
he
was
calledking
laman

and
he
was
king
over
a
numerous
peoplemosiah


and
he
appointed
teachers
of
the
brethren
of
amulon
in
everyland
which
was
possessed
by
his
people
and
thus
the
language
ofnephi
began
to
be
taught
among
all
the
people
of
the
lamanitesmosiah


and
they
were
a
people
friendly
one
with
another
neverthelessthey
knew
not
god
neither
did
the
brethren
of
amulon
teach
themanything
concerning
the
lord
their
god
neither
the
law
of
mosesnor
did
they
teach
them
the
words
of
abinadimosiah


but
they
taught
them
that
they
should
keep
their
record
andthat
they
might
write
one
to
anothermosiah


and
thus
the
lamanites
began
to
increase
in
riches
and
beganto
trade
one
with
another
and
wax
great
and
began
to
be
acunning
and
a
wise
people
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
world
yea
avery
cunning
people
delighting
in
all
manner
of
wickedness
andplunder
except
it
were
among
their
own
brethrenmosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
amulon
began
to
exerciseauthority
over
alma
and
his
brethren
and
began
to
persecute
himand
cause
that
his
children
should
persecute
their
childrenmosiah


for
amulon
knew
alma
that
he
had
been
one
of
the
kingspriests
and
that
it
was
he
that
believed
the
words
of
abinadiand
was
driven
out
before
the
king
and
therefore
he
was
wrothwith
him
for
he
was
subject
to
king
laman
yet
he
exercisedauthority
over
them
and
put
tasks
upon
them
and
puttaskmasters
over

and
it
came
to
pass
that
so
great
were
their
afflictions
thatthey
began
to
cry
mightily
to
godmosiah


and
amulon
commanded
them
that
they
should
stop
their
criesand
he
put
guards
over
them
to
watch
them
that
whosoever
shouldbe
found
calling
upon
god
should
be
put
to
deathmosiah


and
alma
and
his
people
did
not
raise
their
voices
to
thelord
their
god
but
did
pour
out
their
hearts
to
him
and
he
didknow
the
thoughts
of
their
heartsmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
to
themin
their
afflictions
saying
lift
up
your
heads
and
be
of
goodcomfort
for

and
I

I
do
that

hereafter
and
that
ye
may
know
of
a
surety
thatI

do
visit
my
people
in
their
afflictionsmosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
burdens
which
were
laid
uponalma
and
his
brethren
were
made
light
yea
the
lord
didstrengthen
them
that
they
could
bear
up
their
burdens
with
easeand
they
did
submit
cheerfully
and
with
patience
to
all
the
willof
the

and
it
came
to
pass
that
so
great
was
their
faith
and
theirpatience
that
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto

again
sayingbe

and
he

unto

andI
will
go
with

and
deliver
this

out
of

now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
and
his

in

gathered
their
flocks
together
and
also
of

yea
even
all
the
nighttime

and
in

yea
and
in

had
been
merciful
unto

and
eased

and
now
the
lord
said
unto

and
get

returned
againmosiah


and
now
when
mosiah
had
made
an
end
of
reading
the
recordshis
people
who
tarried
in
the
land
were
struck
with
wonder
andamazementmosiah


for
they
knew
not
what
to
think
for
when
they
beheld
thosethat
had
been
delivered
out
of
bondage
they
were
filled
withexceedingly
great
joymosiah


and
again
when
they
thought
of
their
brethren
who
had
beenslain
by
the
lamanites
they
were
filled
with
sorrow
and
evenshed
many
tears
of
sorrowmosiah


and
again
when
they
thought
of
the
immediate
goodness
ofgod
and
his
power
in
delivering
alma
and
his
brethren
out
of
thehands
of
the
lamanites
and
of
bondage
they
did
raise
theirvoices
and
give
thanks
to
godmosiah


and
again
when
they
thought
upon
the
lamanites
who
weretheir
brethren
of
their
sinful
and
polluted
state
they
werefilled
with
pain
and
anguish
for
the
welfare
of
their
soulsmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
who
were
the
children
ofamulon
and
his
brethren
who
had
taken
to
wife
the
daughters
ofthe
lamanites
were
displeased
with
the
conduct
of
their
fathersand
they
would
no
longer
be
called
by
the
names
of
their
fatherstherefore
they
took
upon
themselves
the
name
of
nephi
that
theymight
be
called
the
children
of
nephi
and
be
numbered
among
thosewho
were
called
nephitesmosiah


and
now
all
the
people
of
zarahemla
were
numbered
with
thenephites
and
this
because
the
kingdom
had
been
conferred
uponnone
but
those
who
were
descendants
of
nephimosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
mosiah
had
made
an
end
ofspeaking
and
reading
to
the
people
he
desired
that
alma
shouldalso
speak
to
the
peoplemosiah


and
alma
did
speak
unto
them
when
they
were
assembledtogether
in
large
bodies
and
he
went
from
one
body
to
anotherpreaching
unto
the
people
repentance
and
faith
on
the
lordmosiah


and
he
did
exhort
the
people
of
limhi
and
his
brethren
allthose
that
had
been
delivered
out
of
bondage
that
they
shouldremember
that
it
was
the
lord
that
did
deliver
themmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
alma
had
taught
the
peoplemany
things
and
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
to
them
that
kinglimhi
was
desirous
that
he
might
be
baptized
and
all
his
peoplewere
desirous
that
they
might
be
baptized
alsomosiah


therefore
alma
did
go
forth
into
the
water
and
did
baptizethem
yea
he
did
baptize
them
after
the
manner
he
did
hisbrethren
in
the
waters
of
mormon
yea
and
as
many
as
he
didbaptize
did
belong
to
the
church
of
god
and
this
because
oftheir
belief
on
the
words
of
almamosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
mosiah
granted
unto
alma
thathe
might
establish
churches
throughout
all
the
land
of
zarahemlaand
gave
him
power
to
ordain
priests
and
teachers
over
everychurchmosiah


now
this
was
done
because
there
were
so
many
people
that
theycould
not
all
be
governed
by
one
teacher
neither
could
they
allhear
the
word
of
god
in
one
assemblymosiah


therefore
they
did
assemble
themselves
together
in
differentbodies
being
called
churches
every
church
having
their
priestsand
their
teachers
and
every
priest
preaching
the
word
accordingas
it
was
delivered
to
him
by
the
mouth
of
almamosiah


and
thus
notwithstanding
there
being
many
churches
they
wereall
one
church
yea
even
the
church
of
god
for
there
wasnothing
preached
in
all
the
churches
except
it
were
repentanceand
faith
in
godmosiah


and
now
there
were
seven
churches
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
were
desirous
to
take
uponthem
the
name
of
christ
or
of
god
they
did
join
the
churches
ofgodmosiah


and
they
were
called
the
people
of
god

and
the
lord
didpour
out
his
spirit
upon
them
and
they
were
blessed
andprospered
in
the
landmosiah
chapter
mosiah


now
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
of
the
risinggeneration
that
could
not
understand
the
words
of
king
benjaminbeing
little
children
at
the
time
he
spake
unto
his
people
andthey
did
not
believe
the
tradition
of
their
fathersmosiah


they
did
not
believe
what
had
been
said
concerning
theresurrection
of
the
dead
neither
did
they
believe
concerning
thecoming
of
christmosiah


and
now
because
of
their
unbelief
they
could
not
understandthe
word
of
god
and
their
hearts
were
hardenedmosiah


and
they
would
not
be
baptized
neither
would
they
join
thechurch

and
they
were
a
separate
people
as
to
their
faith
andremained
so
ever
after
even
in
their
carnal
and
sinful
statefor
they
would
not
call
upon
the
lord
their
godmosiah


and
now
in
the
reign
of
mosiah
they
were
not
half
so
numerousas
the
people
of
god
but
because
of
the
dissensions
among
thebrethren
they
became
more
numerousmosiah


for
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
deceive
many
with
theirflattering
words
who
were
in
the
church
and
did
cause
them
tocommit
many
sins
therefore
it
became
expedient
that
those
whocommitted
sin
that
were
in
the
church
should
be
admonished
bythe
churchmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
brought
before
the
priestsand
delivered
up
unto
the
priests
by
the
teachers
and
thepriests
brought
them
before
alma
who
was
the
high
priestmosiah


now
king
mosiah
had
given
alma
the
authority
over
the
churchmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
did
not
know
concerning
thembut
there
were
many
witnesses
against
them
yea
the
people
stoodand
testified
of
their
iniquity
in
abundancemosiah


now
there
had
not
any
such
thing
happened
before
in
thechurch
therefore
alma
was
troubled
in
his
spirit
and
he
causedthat
they
should
be
brought
before
the
kingmosiah


and
he
said
unto
the
king
behold
here
are
many
whom
we
havebrought
before
thee
who
are
accused
of
their
brethren
yea
andthey
have
been
taken
in
divers
iniquities

and
they
do
notrepent
of
their
iniquities
therefore
we
have
brought
them
beforethee
that
thou
mayest
judge
them
according
to
their
crimesmosiah


but
king
mosiah
said
unto
alma
behold
I
judge
them
nottherefore
I
deliver
them
into
thy
hands
to
be
judgedmosiah


and
now
the
spirit
of
alma
was
again
troubled
and
he
wentand
inquired
of
the
lord
what
he
should
do
concerning
thismatter
for
he
feared
that
he
should
do
wrong
in
the
sight
ofgodmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
poured
out
his
wholesoul
to
god
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
to
him
sayingmosiah


blessed
art
thou
alma
and
blessed
are
they
who
werebaptized
in
the
waters
of
mormon

thou
art
blessed
because
ofthy
exceeding
faith
in

and

they
because
of
their
exceeding
faith
in

and
blessed

because
thou

willing
to

they
are

and
because
thou
hast
inquired
of
me
concerning
thetransgressor
thou
art
blessedmosiah


thou
art
my
servant
and
I
covenant
with
thee
that

and
thou

me
and
go
forth
in

and

gather
together

and
he
that
will
hear
my
voice
shall
be
my
sheep
and
himshall
ye
receive
into
the
church
and
him
will
I
also
receivemosiah


for
behold
this
is
my
church
whosoever
is
baptized
shall
bebaptized
unto
repentance

and
whomsoever
ye
receive
shallbelieve
in
my
name
and
him
will
I
freely
forgivemosiah


for
it
is
I
that
taketh
upon
me
the
sins
of
the
world
for
itis
I
that
hath
created
them
and
it
is
I
that
granteth
unto
himthat
believeth
unto
the
end
a
place
at
my
right
handmosiah


for
behold
in
my
name
are
they
called
and
if
they
know
methey
shall
come
forth
and
shall
have
a
place
eternally
at
myright
handmosiah


and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
the
second
trump
shallsound
then
shall
they
that
never
knew
me
come
forth
and
shallstand
before
memosiah


and
then
shall
they
know
that
I
am
the
lord
their
god
that
Iam
their
redeemer
but
they
would
not
be
redeemedmosiah


and
then
I
will
confess
unto
them
that
I
never
knew
them
andthey
shall
depart
into
everlasting
fire
prepared
for
the
deviland
his
angelsmosiah


therefore
I
say
unto
you
that
he
that
will
not
hear
myvoice
the
same
shall
ye
not
receive
into
my
church
for
him
Iwill
not
receive
at
the
last
daymosiah


therefore
I
say
unto
you
go
and
whosoever
transgressethagainst
me
him
shall
ye
judge
according
to
the
sins
which
he
hascommitted
and
if
he
confess
his
sins
before
thee
and
me
andrepenteth
in
the
sincerity
of
his
heart
him
shall
ye
forgiveand
I
will
forgive
him
alsomosiah


yea
and
as
often
as
my
people
repent
will
I
forgive
themtheir
trespasses
against
memosiah


and
ye
shall
also
forgive
one
another
your
trespasses
forverily
I
say
unto
you
he
that
forgiveth
not
his
neighborstrespasses
when
he
says
that
he
repents
the

broughthimself
under

now
I
say
unto
you
go
and
whosoever
will
not
repent
of
hissins
the
same
shall
not
be
numbered
among
my
people
and
thisshall
be
observed
from
this
time
forwardmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
when
alma
had
heard
these
words
he
wrotethem
down
that
he
might
have
them
and
that
he
might
judge
thepeople
of
that
church
according
to
the
commandments
of
godmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
went
and
judged
those
that
hadbeen
taken
in
iniquity
according
to
the
word
of
the
lordmosiah


and
whosoever
repented
of
their
sins
and
did
confess
themthem
he
did
number
among
the
people
of
the
churchmosiah


and
those
that
would
not
confess
their
sins
and
repent
oftheir
iniquity
the
same
were
not
numbered
among
the
people
ofthe
church
and
their
names
were
blotted
outmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
did
regulate
all
the
affairs
ofthe
church
and
they
began
again
to
have
peace
and
to
prosperexceedingly
in
the
affairs
of
the
church
walking
circumspectlybefore
god
receiving
many
and
baptizing
manymosiah


and
now
all
these
things
did
alma
and
his
fellow
laborers
dowho
were
over
the
church
walking
in
all
diligence
teaching
theword
of

in
all
things
suffering
all
manner
of
afflictionsbeing
persecuted
by
all
those
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church

and
they
did
admonish
their
brethren
and
they
were
alsoadmonished
every
one
by
the
word
of
god
according
to
his
sinsor
to
the

which
he
had
committed

without
ceasing

to
give

chapter
mosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
persecutions
which
wereinflicted
on
the
church
by
the
unbelievers
became
so
great
thatthe
church
began
to
murmur
and
complain
to
their
leadersconcerning
the
matter
and
they
did
complain
to
alma

and
almalaid
the
case
before
their
king
mosiah

and
mosiah
consultedwith
his
priestsmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
mosiah
sent
a
proclamationthroughout
the
land
round
about
that
there
should
not
anyunbeliever
persecute
any
of
those
who
belonged
to
the
church
ofgodmosiah


and
there
was
a
strict
command
throughout
all
the
churchesthat
there
should
be
no
persecutions
among
them
that
thereshould
be
an
equality
among
all
menmosiah


that
they
should
let
no
pride
nor
haughtiness
disturb
theirpeace
that
every
man
should
esteem
his
neighbor
as
himselflaboring
with
their
own
hands
for
their
supportmosiah


yea
and
all
their
priests
and
teachers
should
labor
withtheir
own
hands
for
their
support
in
all
cases
save
it
were
insickness
or
in
much
want
and
doing
these
things
they
didabound
in
the
grace
of
godmosiah


and
there
began
to
be
much
peace
again
in
the
land
and
thepeople
began
to
be
very
numerous
and
began
to
scatter
abroadupon
the
face
of
the
earth
yea
on
the
north
and
on
the
southon
the
east
and
on
the
west
building
large
cities
and
villagesin
all
quarters
of
the
landmosiah


and
the
lord
did
visit
them
and
prosper
them
and
they
becamea
large
and
wealthy
peoplemosiah


now
the
sons
of
mosiah
were
numbered
among
the
unbelieversand
also
one
of
the
sons
of
alma
was
numbered
among
them
hebeing
called
alma
after
his
father
nevertheless
he
became
avery
wicked
and
an
idolatrous
man

and
he
was
a
man
of
manywords
and
did
speak
much
flattery
to
the
people
therefore
heled
many
of
the
people
to
do
after
the
manner
of
his
iniquitiesmosiah


and
he
became
a
great
hinderment
to
the
prosperity
of
thechurch
of
god
stealing
away
the
hearts
of
the
people
causingmuch
dissension
among
the
people
giving
a
chance
for
the
enemyof
god
to
exercise
his
power
over
themmosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
while
he
was
going
about
todestroy
the
church
of
god
for
he
did
go
about
secretly
with
thesons
of
mosiah
seeking
to
destroy
the
church
and
to
lead
astraythe
people
of
the
lord
contrary
to
the
commandments
of
god
oreven
the
kingmosiah


and
as
I
said
unto
you
as
they
were
going
about
rebellingagainst
god
behold
the
angel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
themand
he
descended
as
it
were
in
a
cloud
and
he
spake
as
it
werewith
a
voice
of
thunder
which
caused
the
earth
to
shake
uponwhich
they
stoodmosiah


and
so
great
was
their
astonishment
that
they
fell
to
theearth
and
understood
not
the
words
which
he
spake
unto
themmosiah


nevertheless
he
cried
again
saying
alma
arise
and
standforth
for
why
persecutest
thou
the
church
of
god

for
the
lordhath
said
this
is
my
church
and
I
will
establish
it
andnothing
shall
overthrow
it
save
it
is
the
transgression
of
mypeoplemosiah


and
again
the
angel
said
behold
the
lord
hath
heard
theprayers
of
his
people
and
also
the
prayers
of
his
servant
almawho
is
thy
father
for
he
has
prayed
with
much
faith
concerningthee
that
thou
mightest
be
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truththerefore
for
this
purpose
have
I
come
to
convince
thee
of
thepower
and
authority
of
god
that
the
prayers
of
his
servantsmight
be
answered
according
to
their
faithmosiah


and
now
behold
can
ye
dispute
the
power
of
god

for
beholddoth
not
my
voice
shake
the
earth

and
can
ye
not
also
behold
mebefore
you

and
I
am
sent
from
godmosiah


now
I
say
unto
thee
go
and
remember
the
captivity
of
thyfathers
in
the
land
of
helam
and
in
the
land
of
nephi
andremember
how
great
things
he
has
done
for
them
for
they
were
inbondage
and
he
has
delivered
them

and
now
I
say
unto
theealma
go
thy
way
and
seek
to
destroy
the
church
no
more
thattheir
prayers
may
be
answered
and
this
even
if
thou
wilt
ofthyself
be
cast
offmosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
these
were
the
last
words
whichthe
angel
spake
unto
alma
and
he
departedmosiah


and
now
alma
and
those
that
were
with
him
fell
again
to
theearth
for
great
was
their
astonishment
for
with
their
own
eyesthey
had
beheld
an
angel
of
the
lord
and
his
voice
was
asthunder
which
shook
the
earth
and
they
knew
that
there
wasnothing
save
the
power
of
god
that
could
shake
the
earth
andcause
it
to
tremble
as
though
it
would
part
asundermosiah


and
now
the
astonishment
of
alma
was
so
great
that
he
becamedumb
that
he
could
not
open
his
mouth
yea
and
he
became
weakeven
that
he
could
not
move
his
hands
therefore
he
was
taken
bythose
that
were
with
him
and
carried
helpless
even
until
he
waslaid
before
his
fathermosiah


and
they
rehearsed
unto
his
father
all
that
had
happened
untothem
and
his
father
rejoiced
for
he
knew
that
it
was
the
powerof
godmosiah


and
he
caused
that
a
multitude
should
be
gathered
togetherthat
they
might
witness
what
the
lord
had
done
for
his
son
andalso
for
those
that
were
with
himmosiah


and
he
caused
that
the
priests
should
assemble
themselvestogether
and
they
began
to
fast
and
to
pray
to
the
lord
theirgod
that
he
would
open
the
mouth
of
alma
that
he
might
speakand
also
that
his
limbs
might
receive
their
strengththat
theeyes
of
the
people
might
be
opened
to
see
and
know
of
thegoodness
and
glory
of
godmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
fasted
and
prayed
for
thespace
of
two
days
and
two
nights
the
limbs
of
alma
receivedtheir
strength
and
he
stood
up
and
began
to
speak
unto
thembidding
them
to
be
of
good
comfortmosiah


for
said
he
I
have
repented
of
my
sins
and
have
beenredeemed
of
the
lord
behold
I
am
born
of
the
spiritmosiah


and
the
lord
said
unto
me
marvel
not
that
all
mankind
yeamen
and
women
all
nations
kindreds
tongues
and
people
must
beborn
again
yea
born
of
god
changed
from
their
carnal
andfallen
state
to
a
state
of
righteousness
being
redeemed
of
godbecoming
his
sons
and
daughtersmosiah


and
thus
they
become
new
creatures
and
unless
they
do
thisthey
can
in
nowise
inherit
the
kingdom
of
godmosiah


I
say
unto
you
unless
this
be
the
case
they
must
be
castoff
and
this
I
know
because
I
was
like
to
be
cast
offmosiah


nevertheless
after
wading
through
much
tribulationsrepenting
nigh
unto
death
the
lord
in
mercy
hath
seen
fit
tosnatch
me
out
of
an
everlasting
burning
and
I
am
born
of
godmosiah


my
soul
hath
been
redeemed
from
the
gall
of
bitterness
andbonds
of
iniquity

I
was
in
the
darkest
abyss
but
now
I
beholdthe
marvelous
light
of
god

my
soul
was
racked
with
eternaltorment
but
I
am
snatched
and
my
soul
is
pained
no
moremosiah


I
rejected
my
redeemer
and
denied
that
which
had
been
spokenof
by
our
fathers
but
now
that
they
may
foresee
that
he
willcome
and
that
he
remembereth
every
creature
of
his
creating
hewill
make
himself
manifest
unto
allmosiah


yea
every
knee
shall
bow
and
every
tongue
confess
beforehim

yea
even
at
the
last
day
when
all
men
shall
stand
to
bejudged
of
him
then
shall
they
confess
that
he
is
god
then
shallthey
confess
who
live
without
god
in
the
world
that
thejudgment
of
an
everlasting
punishment
is
just
upon
them
and
theyshall
quake
and
tremble
and
shrink
beneath
the
glance
of
hisallsearching
eyemosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
began
from
this
timeforward
to
teach
the
people
and
those
who
were
with
alma
at
thetime
the
angel
appeared
unto
them
traveling
round
about
throughall
the
land
publishing
to
all
the
people
the
things
which
theyhad
heard
and
seen
and
preaching
the
word
of
god
in
muchtribulation
being
greatly
persecuted
by
those
who
wereunbelievers
being
smitten
by
many
of
themmosiah


but
notwithstanding
all
this
they
did
impart
muchconsolation
to
the
church
confirming
their
faith
and
exhortingthem
with
longsuffering
and
much
travail
to
keep
thecommandments
of
godmosiah


and
four
of
them
were
the
sons
of
mosiah
and
their
nameswere
ammon
and
aaron
and
omner
and
himni
these
were
the
namesof
the
sons
of
mosiahmosiah


and
they
traveled
throughout
all
the
lands
of
zarahemla
andamong
all
the
people
who
were
under
the
reign
of
king
mosiahzealously
striving
to
repair
all
the
injuries
which
they
had
doneto
the
church
confessing
all
their
sins
and
publishing
all
thethings
which
they
had
seen
and
explaining
the
prophecies
and
thescriptures
to
all
who
desired
to
hear
themmosiah


and
thus
they
were
instruments
in
the
hands
of
god
inbringing
many
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
yea
to
theknowledge
of
their
redeemermosiah


and
how
blessed
are
they

for
they
did
publish
peace
theydid
publish
good
tidings
of
good
and
they
did
declare
unto
thepeople
that
the
lord
reignethmosiah
chapter
mosiah


now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
sons
of
mosiah
had
done
allthese
things
they
took
a
small
number
with
them
and
returned
totheir
father
the
king
and
desired
of
him
that
he
would
grantunto
them
that
they
might
with
these
whom
they
had
selected
goup
to
the
land
of
nephi
that
they
might
preach
the
things
whichthey
had
heard
and
that
they
might
impart
the
word
of
god
totheir
brethren
the
lamanitesmosiah


that
perhaps
they
might
bring
them
to
the
knowledge
of
thelord
their
god
and
convince
them
of
the
iniquity
of
theirfathers
and
that
perhaps
they
might
cure
them
of
their
hatredtowards
the
nephites
that
they
might
also
be
brought
to
rejoicein
the
lord
their
god
that
they
might
become
friendly
to
oneanother
and
that
there
should
be
no
more
contentions
in
all
theland
which
the
lord
their
god
had
given
themmosiah


now
they
were
desirous
that
salvation
should
be
declared
toevery
creature
for
they
could
not
bear
that
any
human
soulshould
perish
yea
even
the
very
thoughts
that
any
soul
shouldendure
endless
torment
did
cause
them
to
quake
and
tremblemosiah


and
thus
did
the
spirit
of
the
lord
work
upon
them
for
theywere
the
very
vilest
of
sinners

and
the
lord
saw
fit
in
hisinfinite
mercy
to
spare
them
nevertheless
they
suffered
muchanguish
of
soul
because
of
their
iniquities
suffering
much
andfearing
that
they
should
be
cast
off
forevermosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
plead
with
their
father
manydays
that
they
might
go
up
to
the
land
of
nephimosiah


and
king
mosiah
went
and
inquired
of
the
lord
if
he
should
lethis
sons
go
up
among
the
lamanites
to
preach
the
wordmosiah


and
the
lord
said
unto
mosiah
let
them
go
up
for
many
shallbelieve
on
their
words
and
they
shall
have
eternal
life
and
Iwill
deliver
thy
sons
out
of
the
hands
of
the
lamanitesmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
mosiah
granted
that
they
might
go
anddo
according
to
their
requestmosiah


and
they
took
their
journey
into
the
wilderness
to
go
up
topreach
the
word
among
the
lamanites
and
I
shall
give
an
accountof
their
proceedings
hereaftermosiah


now
king
mosiah
had
no
one
to
confer
the
kingdom
upon
forthere
was
not
any
of
his
sons
who
would
accept
of
the
kingdommosiah


therefore
he
took
the
records
which
were
engraven
on
theplates
of
brass
and
also
the
plates
of
nephi
and
all
the
thingswhich
he
had
kept
and
preserved
according
to
the
commandments
ofgod
after
having
translated
and
caused
to
be
written
the
recordswhich
were
on
the
plates
of
gold
which
had
been
found
by
thepeople
of
limhi
which
were
delivered
to
him
by
the
hand
oflimhimosiah


and
this
he
did
because
of
the
great
anxiety
of
his
peoplefor
they
were
desirous
beyond
measure
to
know
concerning
thosepeople
who
had
been
destroyedmosiah


and
now
he
translated
them
by
the
means
of
those
two
stoneswhich
were
fastened
into
the
two
rims
of
a
bowmosiah


now
these
things
were
prepared
from
the
beginning
and
werehanded
down
from
generation
to
generation
for
the
purpose
ofinterpreting
languagesmosiah


and
they
have
been
kept
and
preserved
by
the
hand
of
thelord
that
he
should
discover
to
every
creature
who
shouldpossess
the
land
the
iniquities
and
abominations
of
his
peoplemosiah


and
whosoever
has
these
things
is
called
seer
after
themanner
of
old
timesmosiah


now
after
mosiah
had
finished
translating
these
recordsbehold
it
gave
an
account
of
the
people
who
were
destroyed
fromthe
time
that
they
were
destroyed
back
to
the
building
of
thegreat
tower
at
the
time
the
lord
confounded
the
language
of
thepeople
and
they
were
scattered
abroad
upon
the
face
of
all
theearth
yea
and
even
from
that
time
back
until
the
creation
ofadammosiah


now
this
account
did
cause
the
people
of
mosiah
to
mournexceedingly
yea
they
were
filled
with
sorrow
nevertheless
itgave
them
much
knowledge
in
the
which
they
did
rejoicemosiah


and
this
account
shall
be
written
hereafter
for
behold
itis
expedient
that
all
people
should
know
the
things
which
arewritten
in
this
accountmosiah


and
now
as
I
said
unto
you
that
after
king
mosiah
had
donethese
things
he
took
the
plates
of
brass
and
all
the
thingswhich
he
had
kept
and
conferred
them
upon
alma
who
was
the
sonof
alma
yea
all
the
records
and
also
the
interpreters
andconferred
them
upon
him
and
commanded
him
that
he
should
keepand
preserve
them
and
also
keep
a
record
of
the
people
handingthem
down
from
one
generation
to
another
even
as
they
had
beenhanded
down
from
the
time
that
lehi
left
jerusalemmosiah
chapter
mosiah


now
when
mosiah
had
done
this
he
sent
out
throughout
all
theland
among
all
the
people
desiring
to
know
their
willconcerning
who
should
be
their
kingmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
people
came
sayingwe
are
desirous
that
aaron
thy
son
should
be
our
king
and
ourrulermosiah


now
aaron
had
gone
up
to
the
land
of
nephi
therefore
the
kingcould
not
confer
the
kingdom
upon
him
neither
would
aaron
takeupon
him
the
kingdom
neither
were
any
of
the
sons
of
mosiahwilling
to
take
upon
them
the
kingdommosiah


therefore
king
mosiah
sent
again
among
the
people
yea
even
awritten
word
sent
he
among
the
people

and
these
were
the
wordsthat
were
written
sayingmosiah


behold
o
ye
my
people
or
my
brethren
for
I
esteem
you
assuch
I
desire
that
ye
should
consider
the
cause
which
ye
arecalled
to
considerfor
ye
are
desirous
to
have
a
kingmosiah


now
I
declare
unto
you
that
he
to
whom
the
kingdom
dothrightly
belong
has
declined
and
will
not
take
upon
him
thekingdommosiah


and
now
if
there
should
be
another
appointed
in
his
steadbehold
I
fear
there
would
rise
contentions
among
you

and
whoknoweth
but
what
my
son
to
whom
the
kingdom
doth
belong
shouldturn
to
be
angry
and
draw
away
a
part
of
this
people
after
himwhich
would
cause
wars
and
contentions
among
you
which
would
bethe
cause
of
shedding
much
blood
and
perverting
the
way
of
thelord
yea
and
destroy
the
souls
of
many
peoplemosiah


now
I
say
unto
you
let
us
be
wise
and
consider
these
thingsfor
we
have
no
right
to
destroy
my
son
neither
should
we
haveany
right
to
destroy
another
if
he
should
be
appointed
in
hissteadmosiah


and
if
my
son
should
turn
again
to
his
pride
and
vain
thingshe
would
recall
the
things
which
he
had
said
and
claim
his
rightto
the
kingdom
which
would
cause
him
and
also
this
people
tocommit
much
sinmosiah


and
now
let
us
be
wise
and
look
forward
to
these
things
anddo
that
which
will
make
for
the
peace
of
this
peoplemosiah


therefore
I
will
be
your
king
the
remainder
of
my
daysnevertheless
let
us
appoint
judges
to
judge
this
peopleaccording
to
our
law
and
we
will
newly
arrange
the
affairs
ofthis
people
for
we
will
appoint
wise
men
to
be
judges
that
willjudge
this
people
according
to
the
commandments
of
godmosiah


now
it
is
better
that
a
man
should
be
judged
of
god
than
ofman
for
the
judgments
of
god
are
always
just
but
the
judgmentsof
man
are
not
always
justmosiah


therefore
if
it
were
possible
that
you
could
have
just
mento
be
your
kings
who
would
establish
the
laws
of
god
and
judgethis
people
according
to
his
commandments
yea
if
ye
could
havemen
for
your
kings
who
would
do
even
as
my
father
benjamin
didfor
this
peopleI
say
unto
you
if
this
could
always
be
the
casethen
it
would
be
expedient
that
ye
should
always
have
kings
torule
over
youmosiah


and
even
I
myself
have
labored
with
all
the
power
andfaculties
which
I
have
possessed
to
teach
you
the
commandmentsof
god
and
to
establish
peace
throughout
the
land
that
thereshould
be
no
wars
nor
contentions
no
stealing
nor
plunderingnor
murdering
nor
any
manner
of
iniquitymosiah


and
whosoever
has
committed
iniquity
him
have
I
punishedaccording
to
the
crime
which
he
has
committed
according
to
thelaw
which
has
been
given
to
us
by
our
fathersmosiah


now
I
say
unto
you
that
because
all
men
are
not
just
it
isnot
expedient
that
ye
should
have
a
king
or
kings
to
rule
overyoumosiah


for
behold
how
much
iniquity
doth
one
wicked
king
cause
tobe
committed
yea
and
what
great
destructionmosiah


yea
remember
king
noah
his
wickedness
and
his
abominationsand
also
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
his
people

beholdwhat
great
destruction
did
come
upon
them
and
also
because
oftheir
iniquities
they
were
brought
into
bondagemosiah


and
were
it
not
for
the
interposition
of
their
allwisecreator
and
this
because
of
their
sincere
repentance
they
mustunavoidably
remain
in
bondage
until
nowmosiah


but
behold
he
did
deliver
them
because
they
did
humblethemselves
before
him
and
because
they
cried
mightily
unto
himhe
did
deliver
them
out
of
bondage
and
thus
doth
the
lord
workwith
his
power
in
all
cases
among
the
children
of
men
extendingthe
arm
of
mercy
towards
them
that
put
their
trust
in
himmosiah


and
behold
now
I
say
unto
you
ye
cannot
dethrone
aniniquitous
king
save
it
be
through
much
contention
and
theshedding
of
much
bloodmosiah


for
behold
he
has
his
friends
in
iniquity
and
he
keepethhis
guards
about
him
and
he
teareth
up
the
laws
of
those
whohave
reigned
in
righteousness
before
him
and
he
trampleth
underhis
feet
the
commandments
of
godmosiah


and
he
enacteth
laws
and
sendeth
them
forth
among
hispeople
yea
laws
after
the
manner
of
his
own
wickedness
andwhosoever
doth
not
obey
his
laws
he
causeth
to
be
destroyed
andwhosoever
doth
rebel
against
him
he
will
send
his
armies
againstthem
to
war
and
if
he
can
he
will
destroy
them
and
thus
anunrighteous
king
doth
pervert
the
ways
of
all
righteousnessmosiah


and
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
it
is
not
expedient
that
suchabominations
should
come
upon
youmosiah


therefore
choose
you
by
the
voice
of
this
people
judgesthat
ye
may
be
judged
according
to
the
laws
which
have
been
givenyou
by
our
fathers
which
are
correct
and
which
were
given
themby
the
hand
of
the
lordmosiah


now
it
is
not
common
that
the
voice
of
the
people
desirethanything
contrary
to
that
which
is
right
but
it
is
common
forthe
lesser
part
of
the
people
to
desire
that
which
is
not
righttherefore
this
shall
ye
observe
and
make
it
your
lawto
do
yourbusiness
by
the
voice
of
the
peoplemosiah


and
if
the
time
comes
that
the
voice
of
the
people
dothchoose
iniquity
then
is
the
time
that
the
judgments
of
god
willcome
upon
you
yea
then
is
the
time
he
will
visit
you
with
greatdestruction
even
as
he
has
hitherto
visited
this
landmosiah


and
now
if
ye
have
judges
and
they
do
not
judge
youaccording
to
the
law
which
has
been
given
ye
can
cause
that
theymay
be
judged
of
a
higher
judgemosiah


If
your
higher
judges
do
not
judge
righteous
judgments
yeshall
cause
that
a
small
number
of
your
lower
judges
should
begathered
together
and
they
shall
judge
your
higher
judgesaccording
to
the
voice
of
the
peoplemosiah


and
I
command
you
to
do
these
things
in
the
fear
of
the
lordand
I
command
you
to
do
these
things
and
that
ye
have
no
kingthat
if
these
people
commit
sins
and
iniquities
they
shall
beanswered
upon
their
own
headsmosiah


for
behold
I
say
unto
you
the
sins
of
many
people
have
beencaused
by
the
iniquities
of
their
kings
therefore
theiriniquities
are
answered
upon
the
heads
of
their
kingsmosiah


and
now
I
desire
that
this
inequality
should
be
no
more
inthis
land
especially
among
this
my
people
but
I
desire
thatthis
land
be
a
land
of
liberty
and
every
man
may
enjoy
hisrights
and
privileges
alike
so
long
as
the

even
as
long
as
any
of
ourposterity
remains
upon
the
face
of
the
landmosiah


and
many
more
things
did
king
mosiah
write
unto
themunfolding
unto
them
all
the
trials
and
troubles
of
a
righteousking
yea
all
the
travails
of
soul
for
their
people
and
alsoall
the
murmurings
of
the
people
to
their
king
and
he
explainedit
all
unto
themmosiah


and
he
told
them
that
these
things
ought
not
to
be
but
thatthe
burden
should
come
upon
all
the
people
that
every
man
mightbear
his
partmosiah


and
he
also
unfolded
unto
them
all
the
disadvantages
theylabored
under
by
having
an
unrighteous
king
to
rule
over
themmosiah


yea
all
his
iniquities
and
abominations
and
all
the
warsand
contentions
and
bloodshed
and
the
stealing
and
theplundering
and
the
committing
of
whoredoms
and
all
manner
ofiniquities
which
cannot
be
enumeratedtelling
them
that
thesethings
ought
not
to
be
that
they
were
expressly
repugnant
to
thecommandments
of
godmosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
after
king
mosiah
had
sent
thesethings
forth
among
the
people
they
were
convinced
of
the
truth
ofhis
wordsmosiah


therefore
they
relinquished
their
desires
for
a
king
andbecame
exceedingly
anxious
that
every
man
should
have
an
equalchance
throughout
all
the
land
yea
and
every
man
expressed
awillingness
to
answer
for
his
own
sinsmosiah


therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
they
assembled
themselvestogether
in
bodies
throughout
the
land
to
cast
in
their
voicesconcerning
who
should
be
their
judges
to
judge
them
according
tothe
law
which
had
been
given
them
and
they
were
exceedinglyrejoiced
because
of
the
liberty
which
had
been
granted
unto
themmosiah


and
they
did
wax
strong
in
love
towards
mosiah
yea
they
didesteem
him
more
than
any
other
man
for
they
did
not
look
uponhim
as
a
tyrant
who
was
seeking
for
gain
yea
for
that
lucrewhich
doth
corrupt
the
soul
for
he
had
not
exacted
riches
ofthem
neither
had
he
delighted
in
the
shedding
of
blood
but
hehad
established
peace
in
the
land
and
he
had
granted
unto
hispeople
that
they
should
be
delivered
from
all
manner
of
bondagetherefore
they
did
esteem
him
yea
exceedingly
beyond
measuremosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
appoint
judges
to
rule
overthem
or
to
judge
them
according
to
the
law
and
this
they
didthroughout
all
the
landmosiah


and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
was
appointed
to
be
the
firstchief

being
also
the
high

his
father
havingconferred
the
office
upon
him
and
having
given
him
the
chargeconcerning
all
the
affairs
of
the
churchmosiah


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
did
walk
in
the
ways
of
thelord
and
he
did
keep
his
commandments
and
he
did
judgerighteous
judgments
and
there
was
continual
peace
through
thelandmosiah


and
thus
commenced
the
reign
of
the
judges
throughout
all
theland
of
zarahemla
among
all
the
people
who
were
called
thenephites
and
alma
was
the

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
his
father
died
being
eightyand
two
years
old
having
lived
to
fulfil

and
it
came
to

now
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of

over
the

of
nephi
from
this

forward
kingmosiah
having

the

of

having
warred
a
goodwarfare
walking
uprightly
before
god
leaving
none
to
reign
inhis
stead
nevertheless
he
had
established
laws
and
they
wereacknowledged
by
the
people
therefore
they
were
obliged
to
abideby
the
laws
which
he
had
madealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
first
year
of
the
reign
ofalma
in
the
judgmentseat
there
was
a
man
brought
before
him
tobe
judged
a
man
who
was
large
and
was
noted
for
his
muchstrengthalma


and
he
had
gone
about
among
the
people
preaching
to
them
thatwhich
he
termed
to
be
the
word
of
god
bearing
down
against
thechurch
declaring
unto
the
people
that
every
priest
and
teacherought
to
become
popular
and
they
ought
not
to
labor
with
theirhands
but
that
they
ought
to
be
supported
by
the
peoplealma


and
he
also
testified
unto
the
people
that
all
mankind
shouldbe
saved
at
the
last
day
and
that
they
need
not
fear
nortremble
but
that
they
might
lift
up
their
heads
and
rejoice
forthe
lord
had
created
all
men
and
had
also
redeemed
all
men
andin
the
end
all
men
should
have
eternal
lifealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
teach
these
things
so
muchthat
many
did
believe
on
his
words
even
so
many
that
they
beganto
support
him
and
give
him
moneyalma


and
he
began
to
be
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
and
towear
very
costly
apparel
yea
and
even
began
to
establish
achurch
after
the
manner
of
his
preachingalma


and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
going
to
preach
to
those
whobelieved
on
his
word
he
met
a
man
who
belonged
to
the
church
ofgod
yea
even
one
of
their
teachers
and
he
began
to
contendwith
him
sharply
that
he
might
lead
away
the
people
of
thechurch
but
the
man
withstood
him
admonishing
him
with
the
wordsof
godalma


now
the
name
of
the
man
was
gideon
and
it
was
he
who
was
aninstrument
in
the
hands
of
god
in
delivering
the
people
of
limhiout
of
bondagealma


now
because
gideon
withstood
him
with
the
words
of
god
he
waswroth
with
gideon
and
drew
his
sword
and
began
to
smite
him
now
gideon
being
stricken
with
many
years
therefore
he
was
notable
to
withstand
his
blows
therefore
he
was
slain
by
the
swordalma


and
the
man
who
slew
him
was
taken
by
the
people
of
thechurch
and
was
brought
before
alma
to
be
judged
according
tothe
crimes
which
he
had
committedalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
stood
before
alma
and
pleaded
forhimself
with
much
boldnessalma


but
alma
said
unto
him
behold
this
is
the
first
time
thatpriestcraft
has
been
introduced
among
this
people

and
beholdthou
art
not
only
guilty
of
priestcraft
but
hast
endeavored
toenforce
it
by
the
sword
and
were
priestcraft
to
be
enforcedamong
this
people
it
would
prove
their
entire
destructionalma


and
thou
hast
shed
the
blood
of
a
righteous
man
yea
a
manwho
has
done
much
good
among
this
people
and
were
we
to
sparethee
his
blood
would
come
upon
us
for
vengeancealma


therefore
thou
art
condemned
to
die
according
to
the
lawwhich
has
been
given
us
by
mosiah
our
last
king
and
it
has
beenacknowledged
by
this
people
therefore
this
people
must
abide
bythe
lawalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
him
and
his
name
wasnehor
and
they
carried
him
upon
the
top
of
the
hill
manti
andthere
he
was
caused
or
rather
did
acknowledge
between
theheavens
and
the
earth
that
what
he
had
taught
to
the
people
wascontrary
to
the
word
of
god
and
there
he
suffered
an
ignominiousdeathalma


nevertheless
this
did
not
put
an
end
to
the
spreading
ofpriestcraft
through
the
land
for
there
were
many
who
loved
thevain
things
of
the
world
and
they
went
forth
preaching
falsedoctrines
and
this
they
did
for
the
sake
of
riches
and
honoralma


nevertheless
they
durst
not
lie
if
it
were
known
for
fearof
the
law
for
liars
were
punished
therefore
they
pretended
topreach
according
to
their
belief
and
now
the
law
could
have
nopower
on
any
man
for
his
beliefalma


and
they
durst
not
steal
for
fear
of
the
law
for
such
werepunished
neither
durst
they
rob
nor
murder
for
he
thatmurdered
was
punished
unto
deathalma


but
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
did
not
belong
to
thechurch
of
god
began
to
persecute
those
that
did
belong
to
thechurch
of
god
and
had
taken
upon
them
the
name
of
christalma


yea
they
did
persecute
them
and
afflict
them
with
allmanner
of
words
and
this
because
of
their
humility
because
theywere
not
proud
in
their
own
eyes
and
because
they
did
impart
theword
of
god
one
with
another
without
money
and
without
pricealma


now
there
was
a
strict
law
among
the
people
of
the
churchthat
there
should
not
any
man
belonging
to
the
church
arise
andpersecute
those
that
did
not
belong
to
the
church
and
that
thereshould
be
no
persecution
among
themselvesalma


nevertheless
there
were
many
among
them
who
began
to
beproud
and
began
to
contend
warmly
with
their
adversaries
evenunto
blows
yea
they
would
smite
one
another
with
their
fistsalma


now
this
was
in
the
second
year
of
the
reign
of
alma
and
itwas
a
cause
of
much
affliction
to
the
church
yea
it
was
thecause
of
much
trial
with
the
churchalma


for
the
hearts
of
many
were
hardened
and
their
names
wereblotted
out
that
they
were
remembered
no
more
among
the
peopleof
god

and
also
many
withdrew
themselves
from
among
themalma


now
this
was
a
great
trial
to
those
that
did
stand
fast
inthe
faith
nevertheless
they
were
steadfast
and
immovable
inkeeping
the
commandments
of
god
and
they
bore
with
patience
thepersecution
which
was
heaped
upon
themalma


and
when
the
priests
left
their
labor
to
impart
the
word
ofgod
unto
the
people
the
people
also
left
their
labors
to
hearthe
word
of
god

and
when
the
priest
had
imparted
unto
them
theword
of
god
they
all
returned
again
diligently
unto
their
laborsand
the
priest
not
esteeming
himself
above
his
hearers
for
thepreacher
was
no
better
than
the
hearer
neither
was
the
teacherany
better
than
the
learner
and
thus
they
were
all
equal
andthey
did
all
labor
every
man
according
to
his
strengthalma


and
they
did
impart
of
their
substance
every
man
accordingto
that
which
he
had
to
the
poor
and
the
needy
and
the
sickand
the
afflicted
and
they
did
not
wear
costly
apparel
yet
theywere
neat
and
comelyalma


and
thus
they
did
establish
the
affairs
of
the
church
andthus
they
began
to
have
continual
peace
again
notwithstandingall
their
persecutionsalma


and
now
because
of
the
steadiness
of
the
church
they
beganto
be
exceedingly
rich
having
abundance
of
all
things
whatsoeverthey
stood
in
needan
abundance
of
flocks
and
herds
andfatlings
of
every
kind
and
also
abundance
of
grain
and
of
goldand
of
silver
and
of
precious
things
and
abundance
of
silk
andfinetwined
linen
and
all
manner
of
good
homely
clothalma


and
thus
in
their
prosperous
circumstances
they
did
notsend
away
any
who
were
naked
or
that
were
hungry
or
that
wereathirst
or
that
were
sick
or
that
had
not
been
nourished
andthey
did
not
set
their
hearts
upon
riches
therefore
they
wereliberal
to
all
both
old
and
young
both
bond
and
free
both
maleand
female
whether
out
of
the
church
or
in
the
church
having
norespect
to
persons
as
to
those
who
stood
in
needalma


and
thus
they
did
prosper
and
become
far
more
wealthy
thanthose
who
did
not
belong
to
their
churchalma


for
those
who
did
not
belong
to
their
church
did
indulgethemselves
in
sorceries
and
in
idolatry
or
idleness
and
inbabblings
and
in
envyings
and
strife
wearing
costly
apparelbeing
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
own
eyes
persecutinglying
thieving
robbing
committing
whoredoms
and
murderingand
all
manner
of
wickedness
nevertheless
the
law
was
put
inforce
upon
all
those
who
did
transgress
it
inasmuch
as
it
waspossiblealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
by
thus
exercising
the
law
uponthem
every
man
suffering
according
to
that
which
he
had
donethey
became
more
still
and
durst
not
commit
any
wickedness
if
itwere
known
therefore
there
was
much
peace
among
the
people
ofnephi
until
the
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judgesalma
chapter
alma


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
fifth
year
oftheir
reign
there
began
to
be
a
contention
among
the
people
fora
certain
man
being
called
amlici
he
being
a
very
cunning
manyea
a
wise
man
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
world
he
being
after
theorder
of
the
man
that
slew
gideon
by
the
sword
who
was
executedaccording
to
the
lawalma


now
this
amlici
had
by
his
cunning
drawn
away
much
peopleafter
him
even
so
much
that
they
began
to
be
very
powerful
andthey
began
to
endeavor
to
establish
amlici
to
be
king
over
thepeoplealma


now
this
was
alarming
to
the
people
of
the
church
and
also
toall
those
who
had
not
been
drawn
away
after
the
persuasions
ofamlici
for
they
knew
that
according
to
their
law
that
suchthings
must
be
established
by
the
voice
of
the
peoplealma


therefore
if
it
were
possible
that
amlici
should
gain
thevoice
of
the
people
he
being
a
wicked
man
would
deprive
themof
their
rights
and
privileges
of
the
church
for
it
was
hisintent
to
destroy
the
church
of
godalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
assembled
themselvestogether
throughout
all
the
land
every
man
according
to
hismind
whether
it
were
for
or
against
amlici
in
separate
bodieshaving
much
dispute
and
wonderful
contentions
one
with
anotheralma


and
thus
they
did
assemble
themselves
together
to
cast
intheir
voices
concerning
the
matter
and
they
were
laid
before
thejudgesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
people
came
againstamlici
that
he
was
not
made
king
over
the
peoplealma


now
this
did
cause
much
joy
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
wereagainst
him
but
amlici
did
stir
up
those
who
were
in
his
favorto
anger
against
those
who
were
not
in
his
favoralma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
gathered
themselves
togetherand
did
consecrate
amlici
to
be
their
kingalma


now
when
amlici
was
made
king
over
them
he
commanded
themthat
they
should
take
up
arms
against
their
brethren
and
this
hedid
that
he
might
subject
them
to
himalma


now
the
people
of
amlici
were
distinguished
by
the
name
ofamlici
being
called
amlicites
and
the
remainder
were
callednephites
or
the
people
of
godalma


therefore
the
people
of
the
nephites
were
aware
of
the
intentof
the
amlicites
and
therefore
they
did
prepare
to
meet
themyea
they
did
arm
themselves
with
swords
and
with
cimeters
andwith
bows
and
with
arrows
and
with
stones
and
with
slings
andwith
all
manner
of
weapons
of
war
of
every
kindalma


and
thus
they
were
prepared
to
meet
the
amlicites
at
the
timeof
their
coming

and
there
were
appointed
captains
and
highercaptains
and
chief
captains
according
to
their
numbersalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
amlici
did
arm
his
men
with
allmanner
of
weapons
of
war
of
every
kind
and
he
also
appointedrulers
and
leaders
over
his
people
to
lead
them
to
war
againsttheir
brethrenalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
amlicites
came
upon
the
hillamnihu
which
was
east
of
the
river
sidon
which
ran
by
the
landof
zarahemla
and
there
they
began
to
make
war
with
the
nephitesalma


now
alma
being
the
chief
judge
and
the
governor
of
thepeople
of
nephi
therefore
he
went
up
with
his
people
yea
withhis
captains
and
chief
captains
yea
at
the
head
of
his
armiesagainst
the
amlicites
to
battlealma


and
they

strength
insomuch
that
many
of
the
nephites
did
fallbefore
the
amlicitesalma


nevertheless
the
lord
did
strengthen
the
hand
of
thenephites
that
they
slew
the
amlicites
with
great
slaughter

began
to
flee
before
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
did
pursue
theamlicites
all
that
day
and
did
slay
them
with
much
slaughterinsomuch
that
there
were

there
were

six
thousand
five
hundred
sixty
and
two

and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
alma
could
pursue
the
amlicitesno
longer
he
caused
that
his
people
should
pitch
their
tents
inthe
valley
of
gideon
the
valley
being
called
after
that
gideonwho
was
slain
by
the
hand
of
nehor
with
the
sword
and
in
thisvalley
the
nephites
did
pitch
their
tents
for
the
nightalma


and
alma
sent
spies
to
follow
the
remnant
of
the
amlicitesthat
he
might
know
of
their
plans
and
their
plots
whereby
hemight
guard
himself
against
them
that
he
might
preserve
hispeople
from
being
destroyedalma


now
those
whom
he
had
sent
out
to
watch
the
camp
of
theamlicites
were
called
zeram
and
amnor
and
manti
and
limherthese
were
they
who
went
out
with
their
men
to
watch
the
camp
ofthe
amlicitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
they
returned
into
thecamp
of
the
nephites
in
great
haste
being
greatly
astonishedand
struck
with
much
fear
sayingalma


behold
we
followed
the
camp
of
the
amlicites
and
to
ourgreat
astonishment
in
the
land
of
minon
above
the
land
ofzarahemla
in
the
course
of
the
land
of
nephi
we
saw
a
numeroushost
of
the
lamanites
and
behold
the
amlicites
have
joinedthemalma


and
they
are
upon
our
brethren
in
that
land
and
they
arefleeing
before
them
with
their
flocks
and
their

we
make

they
obtainpossession
of

our
fathers

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
nephi
took
theirtents
and
departed
out
of
the
valley
of
gideon
towards
theircity
which
was
the
city
of
zarahemlaalma


and
behold
as
they
were
crossing
the
river
sidon
thelamanites
and
the
amlicites
being
as
numerous
almost
as
itwere
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
came
upon
them
to
destroy
themalma


nevertheless
the
nephites
being
strengthened
by
the
hand
ofthe
lord
having
prayed
mightily
to
him
that
he
would
deliverthem
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
therefore
the
lord
didhear
their
cries
and
did
strengthen
them
and
the
lamanites
andthe
amlicites
did
fall
before
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
fought
with
amlici
with
thesword
face
to
face
and
they
did
contend
mightily
one
withanotheralma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
being
a
man
of
god
beingexercised
with
much
faith
cried
saying
o
lord
have
mercy
andspare
my
life
that
I
may
be
an
instrument
in
thy
hands
to
saveand
preserve
this
peoplealma


now
when
alma
had
said
these
words
he
contended
again
withamlici
and
he
was
strengthened
insomuch
that
he
slew
amliciwith
the
swordalma


and
he
also
contended
with
the
king
of
the
lamanites
but
theking
of
the
lamanites
fled
back
from
before
alma
and
sent
hisguards
to
contend
with
almaalma


but
alma
with
his
guards
contended
with
the
guards
of
theking
of
the
lamanites
until
he
slew
and
drove
them
backalma


and
thus
he
cleared
the
ground
or
rather
the
bank
which
wason
the
west
of
the
river
sidon
throwing
the
bodies
of
thelamanites
who
had
been
slain
into
the
waters
of
sidon
thatthereby
his
people
might
have
room
to
cross
and
contend
with
thelamanites
and
the
amlicites
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
sidonalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
all
crossed
the
riversidon
that
the
lamanites
and
the
amlicites
began
to
flee
beforethem
notwithstanding
they
were
so
numerous
that
they
could
notbe
numberedalma


and
they
fled
before
the
nephites
towards
the
wildernesswhich
was
west
and
north
away
beyond
the
borders
of
the
landand
the
nephites
did
pursue
them
with
their
might

did
slaythemalma

they
were
met
on
every
hand
and
slain
and
driven
untilthey
were
scattered
on
the
west
and
on
the
north
until
they
hadreached
the
wilderness
which
was
called

and
it
wasthat
part
of
the
wilderness
which
was
infested
by
wild
andravenous
beastsalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
many
died
in
the
wilderness
of
theirwounds
and
were
devoured
by
those
beasts

also
the
vulturesof

their
bones

have
been

chapter
alma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
who
were
not
slain
bythe
weapons
of
war
after
having
buried
those
who
had
beenslainnow
the
number
of
the
slain
were
not
numbered
because
ofthe
greatness
of
their
numberafter
they
had
finished
buryingtheir
dead
they
all
returned
to
their
lands
and
to
their
housesand
their
wives
and
their
childrenalma


now
many
women
and
children
had
been
slain
with
the
sword
andalso
many
of
their
flocks
and
their
herds
and
also
many
of
theirfields
of
grain
were
destroyed
for
they
were
trodden
down
by
thehosts
of
menalma


and
now
as
many
of
the
lamanites
and
the
amlicites
who
hadbeen
slain
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
sidon
were
cast
into
thewaters
of
sidon
and
behold
their
bones
are
in
the
depths
of
thesea
and
they
are
manyalma


and
the
amlicites
were
distinguished
from
the
nephites
forthey
had
marked
themselves
with
red
in
their
foreheads
after
themanner
of
the
lamanites
nevertheless
they
had
not
shorn
theirheads
like
unto
the
lamanitesalma


now
the
heads
of
the
lamanites
were
shorn
and
they
werenaked
save
it
were
skin
which
was
girded
about
their
loins
andalso
their
armor
which
was
girded
about
them
and
their
bowsand
their
arrows
and
their
stones
and
their
slings
and
soforthalma


and
the
skins
of
the
lamanites
were
dark
according
to
themark
which
was
set
upon
their
fathers
which
was
a
curse
uponthem
because
of
their
transgression
and
their
rebellion
againsttheir
brethren
who
consisted
of
nephi
jacob
and
joseph
andsam
who
were
just
and
holy
menalma


and
their
brethren
sought
to
destroy
them
therefore
they
werecursed
and
the
lord
god
set
a
mark
upon
them
yea
upon
lamanand
lemuel
and
also
the
sons
of
Ishmael
and
Ishmaelitish
womenalma


and
this
was
done
that
their
seed
might
be
distinguished
fromthe
seed
of
their
brethren
that
thereby
the
lord
god
mightpreserve
his
people
that
they
might
not
mix
and
believe
inincorrect
traditions
which
would
prove
their
destructionalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
did
mingle
his
seed
withthat
of
the
lamanites
did
bring
the
same
curse
upon
his
seedalma


therefore
whosoever
suffered
himself
to
be
led
away
by
thelamanites
was
called
under
that
head
and
there
was
a
mark
setupon
himalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
would
not
believe
in
thetradition
of
the
lamanites
but
believed
those
records
which
werebrought
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
also
in
the
traditionof
their
fathers
which
were
correct
who
believed
in
thecommandments
of
god
and
kept
them
were
called
the
nephites
orthe
people
of
nephi
from
that
time
forthalma


and
it
is
they
who
have
kept
the
records
which
are
true
oftheir
people
and
also
of
the
people
of
the
lamanitesalma


now
we
will
return
again
to
the
amlicites
for
they
also
hada
mark
set
upon
them
yea
they
set
the
mark
upon
themselvesyea
even
a
mark
of
red
upon
their
foreheadsalma


thus
the
word
of
god
is
fulfilled
for
these
are
the
wordswhich
he
said
to
nephi
behold
the
lamanites
have
I
cursed
andI
will
set
a
mark
on
them
that
they
and
their
seed
may
beseparated
from
thee
and
thy
seed
from
this
time
henceforth
andforever
except
they
repent
of
their
wickedness
and
turn
to
methat
I
may
have
mercy
upon
themalma


and
again
I
will
set
a
mark
upon
him
that
mingleth
his
seedwith
thy
brethren
that
they
may
be
cursed
alsoalma


and
again
I
will
set
a
mark
upon
him
that
fighteth
againstthee
and
thy
seedalma


and
again
I
say
he
that
departeth
from
thee
shall
no
more
becalled
thy
seed
and
I
will
bless
thee
and
whomsoever
shall
becalled
thy
seed
henceforth
and
forever
and
these
were
thepromises
of
the
lord
unto
nephi
and
to
his
seedalma


now
the
amlicites
knew
not
that
they
were
fulfilling
thewords
of
god
when
they
began
to
mark
themselves
in
theirforeheads
nevertheless
they
had
come
out
in
open
rebellionagainst
god
therefore
it
was
expedient
that
the
curse
shouldfall
upon
themalma


now
I
would
that
ye
should
see
that
they
brought
uponthemselves
the
curse
and
even
so
doth
every
man
that
is
cursedbring
upon
himself
his
own
condemnationalma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
not
many
days
after
the
battle
whichwas
fought
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
by
the
lamanites
and
theamlicites
that
there
was
another
army
of
the
lamanites
came
inupon
the
people
of
nephi
in
the
same
place
where
the
first
armymet
the
amlicitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
an
army
sent
to
drive
themout
of
their
landalma


now
alma
himself
being
afflicted
with
a
wound
did
not
go
upto
battle
at
this
time
against
the
lamanitesalma


but
he
sent
up
a
numerous
army
against
them
and
they
went
upand
slew
many
of
the
lamanites
and
drove
the
remainder
of
themout
of
the
borders
of
their
landalma


and
then
they
returned
again
and
began
to
establish
peace
inthe
land
being
troubled
no
more
for
a
time
with
their
enemiesalma


now
all
these
things
were
done
yea
all
these
wars
andcontentions
were
commenced
and
ended
in
the
fifth

now
it
came
to

in

sixth
year
of
the
reign
of

over
the
people
of
nephi
there
were
no
contentions
norwars
in
the
land

but
the
people
were
afflicted
yea
greatly
afflicted
for
theloss
of
their
brethren
and
also
for
the
loss
of
their
flocks
andherds
and
also
for
the
loss
of
their
fields
of
grain
which
weretrodden
under
foot
and
destroyed
by
the
lamanitesalma


and
so
great
were
their
afflictions
that
every
soul
had
causeto
mourn
and
they
believed
that
it
was
the
judgments
of
god
sentupon
them
because
of
their
wickedness
and
their
abominationstherefore
they
were
awakened
to
a
remembrance
of
their
dutyalma


and
they
began
to
establish
the
church
more
fully
yea
andmany
were
baptized
in
the
waters
of
sidon
and
were
joined
to
thechurch
of

yea
they
were
baptized
by
the
hand
of
alma
whohad
been
consecrated
the
high
priest
over
the
people
of
thechurch
by
the
hand
of
his
father

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudges
there
were
about
three
thousand
five
hundred
souls
thatunited
themselves
to
the
church
of

and
were
baptized

andthus
endeth
the
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
thepeople
of
nephi
and
there
was
continual
peace
in
all
that
timealma


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudges
that
the
people
of
the
church
began
to
wax
proud
becauseof
their
exceeding
riches
and
their
fine
silks
and
theirfinetwined
linen
and
because
of
their
many
flocks
and
herdsand
their
gold
and
their
silver
and
all
manner
of
preciousthings
which
they
had
obtained
by
their
industry
and
in
allthese
things
were
they
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
eyes
forthey
began
to
wear
very
costly
apparelalma


now
this
was
the
cause
of
much
affliction
to
alma
yea
and
tomany
of
the
people
whom
alma
had
consecrated
to
be
teachers
andpriests
and
elders
over
the
church
yea
many
of
them
weresorely
grieved
for
the
wickedness
which
they
saw
had
begun
to
beamong
their
peoplealma


for
they
saw
and
beheld
with
great
sorrow
that
the
people
ofthe
church
began
to
be
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
eyes
andto
set
their
hearts
upon
riches
and
upon
the
vain
things
of
theworld
that
they
began
to
be
scornful
one
towards
another
andthey
began
to
persecute
those
that
did
not
believe
according
totheir
own
will
and
pleasurealma


and
thus
in
this
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judgesthere
began
to
be
great
contentions
among
the
people
of
thechurch
yea
there
were
envyings
and
strife
and
malice
andpersecutions
and
pride
even
to
exceed
the
pride
of
those
whodid
not
belong
to
the
church
of
godalma


and
thus
ended
the
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judgesand
the
wickedness
of
the
church
was
a
great
stumblingblock
tothose
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church
and
thus
the
church
beganto
fail
in
its
progressalma


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
ninth
yearalma
saw
the
wickedness
of
the
church
and
he
saw
also
that
theexample
of
the
church
began
to
lead
those
who
were
unbelievers
onfrom
one
piece
of
iniquity
to
another
thus
bringing
on
thedestruction
of
the
peoplealma


yea
he
saw
great
inequality
among
the
people
some
liftingthemselves
up
with
their
pride
despising
others
turning
theirbacks
upon
the
needy
and
the
naked
and
those
who
were
hungry
andthose
who
were
athirst
and
those
who
were
sick
and
afflictedalma


now
this
was
a
great
cause
for
lamentations
among
the
peoplewhile
others
were
abasing
themselves
succoring
those
who
stoodin
need
of
their
succor
such
as
imparting
their
substance
to
thepoor
and
the
needy
feeding
the
hungry
and
suffering
all
mannerof
afflictions
for
christs
sake
who
should
come
according
tothe
spirit
of
prophecyalma


looking
forward
to
that
day
thus
retaining
a
remission
oftheir
sins
being
filled
with
great
joy
because
of
theresurrection
of
the
dead
according
to
the
will
and
power
anddeliverance
of
jesus
christ
from
the
bands
of
deathalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
having
seen
theafflictions
of
the
humble
followers
of
god
and
the
persecutionswhich
were
heaped
upon
them
by
the
remainder
of
his
people
andseeing
all
their
inequality
began
to
be
very
sorrowfulnevertheless
the
spirit
of
the
lord
did
not
fail
himalma


and
he
selected
a
wise
man
who
was
among
the
elders
of
thechurch
and
gave
him
power
according
to
the
voice
of
the
peoplethat
he
might
have
power
to
enact
laws
according
to
the
lawswhich
had
been
given
and
to
put
them
in
force
according
to
thewickedness
and
the
crimes
of
the
peoplealma


now
this
mans
name
was
nephihah
and
he
was
appointed
chiefjudge
and
he
sat
in
the
judgmentseat
to
judge
and
to
govern
thepeoplealma


now
alma
did
not
grant
unto
him
the
office
of
being
highpriest
over
the
church
but
he
retained
the
office
of
high
priestunto
himself
but
he
delivered
the
judgmentseat
unto
nephihahalma


and
this
he
did
that
he
himself
might
go
forth
among
hispeople
or
among
the
people
of

andalso
that
ye
are
guilty
of
all
manner
of
wickednessalma


behold
my
brethren
do
ye
suppose
that
such
an
one
can
havea
place
to
sit
down
in
the
kingdom
of
god
with
abraham
withIsaac
and
with

I

nay
except
ye
make
our
creator
a
liar
fromthe
beginning
or
suppose
that
he
is
a
liar
from
the
beginningye
cannot
suppose
that
such
can
have
place
in
the
kingdom
ofheaven
but
they
shall
be
cast
out
for
they
are
the
children
ofthe
kingdom
of
the
devilalma


and
now
behold
I
say
unto
you

if
ye
haveexperienced
a
change
of
heart
and
if
ye
have
felt
to
sing
thesong
of
redeeming
love
I
would
ask
can
ye
feel
so
nowalma


have
ye
walked
keeping
yourselves
blameless
before
god
could
ye
say
if
ye
were
called
to
die
at
this
time
withinyourselves
that
ye
have
been
sufficiently
humble

that
yourgarments
have
been
cleansed
and
made
white
through
the
blood
ofchrist
who
will
come
to
redeem
his
people
from
their
sinsalma


behold
are
ye
stripped
of
pride

I
say
unto
you
if
ye
arenot
ye
are
not
prepared

for
behold
the
time
is
at
hand
that
whosoever
bringeth

good
fruit
or
whosoever
doeth
not
the
works
ofrighteousness

have
cause
to
wail
and
mournalma


o
ye
workers
of
iniquity
ye
that
are
puffed
up
in
the
vainthings
of
the
world
ye
that
have
professed
to
have
known
theways
of
righteousness
nevertheless
have
gone
astray
as
sheephaving
no
shepherd
notwithstanding
a
shepherd
hath
called
afteryou
and

still
calling
after
you
but
ye
will
not
hearken
untohis
voicealma

and
now
if
ye
are

alma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
alma
had
made
an
end
ofspeaking
unto
the
people
of
the
church
which
was
established
inthe
city
of
zarahemla
he
ordained
priests
and
elders
by
layingon
his
hands
according
to
the
order
of
god
to
preside
and
watchover
the
churchalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
did
not
belong
to
thechurch
who
repented
of
their
sins
were
baptized
unto
repentanceand
were
received
into
the
churchalma


and
it
also
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
did
belong
to
thechurch
that
did
not
repent
of
their
wickedness
and
humblethemselves
before
godI
mean
those
who
were
lifted
up
in
thepride
of
their
heartsthe
same
were
rejected
and
their
nameswere
blotted
out
that
their
names
were
not
numbered
among
thoseof
the
righteousalma


and
thus
they
began
to
establish
the
order
of
the
church
inthe
city
of
zarahemlaalma


now
I
would
that
ye
should
understand
that
the
word
of
god
wasliberal
unto
all
that
none
were
deprived
of
the
privilege
ofassembling
themselves
together
to
hear
the
word
of
godalma


nevertheless
the
children
of
god
were
commanded
that
theyshould
gather
themselves
together
oft
and
join
in
fasting
andmighty
prayer
in
behalf
of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
of
those
whoknew
not
godalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
alma
had
made
theseregulations
he
departed
from
them
yea
from
the
church
which
wasin
the
city
of
zarahemla
and
went
over
upon
the
east
of
theriver
sidon
into
the
valley
of
gideon
there
having
been
a
citybuilt
which
was
called
the
city
of
gideon
which
was
in
thevalley
that
was
called
gideon
being
called
after
the
man
who
wasslain
by
the
hand
of
nehor
with
the
swordalma


and
alma
went
and
began
to
declare
the
word
of
god
unto
thechurch
which
was
established
in
the
valley
of
gideon
accordingto
the
revelation
of
the
truth
of
the
word
which
had
been
spokenby
his
fathers
and
according
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
which
wasin
him
according
to
the
testimony
of
jesus
christ
the
son
ofgod
who
should
come
to
redeem
his
people
from
their
sins
andthe
holy
order
by
which
he
was
called

mercy
hath
granted
that
I
should
comeunto

and
behold
I
have
come
having
great
hopes
and
much
desirethat
I
should
find
that
ye
had
humbled
yourselves
before
god
andthat
ye
had
continued
in
the
supplicating
of
his
grace
that
Ishould
find
that
ye
were
blameless
before
him
that
I
should
findthat
ye
were
not
in
the
awful
dilemma
that
our
brethren
were
inat

but
blessed
be
the
name
of

that
he
hath
given
me
to
knowyea

given
unto

the
exceedingly
great
joy
of

have
joy
over

nevertheless
I
do
not
desirethat
my
joy
over

should
come
by
the
cause
of
so
muchafflictions
and
sorrow
which
I
have
had
for

the
vain
things
of

that
ye

forward
for

I
say
unto

theway
that
I

now
because
your
faith

that
yea
concerning

things
which
I
have
spokengreat
is
my

for
as
I
said
unto

from
the
beginning
that
I
had
muchdesire
that
ye
were
not
in
the
state
of
dilemma
like
yourbrethren
even
so
I
have
found
that
my
desires
have
beengratifiedalma


for
I
perceive
that
ye
are
in
the
paths
of

Iperceive
that
ye
are
in
the
path
which
leads

the
kingdom
ofgod
yea
I
perceive
that
ye
are
making
his
paths
straightalma


I
perceive
that
it
has
been
made
known
unto
you
by
thetestimony
of
his
word
that
he
cannot
walk
in
crooked
pathsneither
doth
he
vary
from
that
which
he
hath
said
neither
hathhe
a
shadow
of
turning
from
the
right
to
the
left
or
from
thatwhich
is
right
to
that
which
is
wrong
therefore
his
course
isone
eternal
roundalma


and
he
doth
not
dwell
in
unholy
temples
neither
canfilthiness
or
anything
which
is
unclean

I
say
unto

last
day
that

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
returned
from
the
land

after
having
taught
the
people
of
gideon
many
thingswhich
cannot
be
written
having
established
the
order
of
thechurch
according
as
he
had
before
done
in
the
land
of

he
returned
to
his
own
house
at
zarahemla
to
rest
himselffrom
the
labors
which
he
had
performedalma


and
thus
ended
the
ninth
year

reign

judges
overthe
people
of

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
tenth
year
ofthe
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
that
almadeparted
from
thence
and
took
his
journey
over
into
the
land
ofmelek
on
the
west
of
the
river
sidon
on
the
west
by
the
bordersof
the
wildernessalma


and
he
began
to
teach
the
people
in
the
land
of
melekaccording
to
the
holy
order
of
god
by
which
he
had
been
calledand
he
began
to
teach
the
people
throughout
all
the
land
ofmelekalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
came
to
him
throughout
allthe
borders
of
the
land
which
was
by
the
wilderness
side

andthey
were
baptized
throughout
all
the
landalma


so
that
when
he
had
finished
his
work
at
melek
he
departedthence
and
traveled
three
days
journey
on
the
north
of
the
landof
melek
and
he
came
to
a
city
which
was
called
ammonihahalma


now
it
was
the
custom
of
the
people
of
nephi
to
call
theirlands
and
their
cities
and
their
villages
yea
even
all
theirsmall
villages
after
the
name
of
him
who
first
possessed
themand
thus
it
was
with
the
land
of
ammonihahalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
alma
had
come
to
the
city
ofammonihah
he
began
to
preach
the
word
of
god
unto
themalma


now
satan
had
gotten
great
hold
upon
the
hearts
of
the
peopleof
the
city
of
ammonihah
therefore
they
would
not
hearken
untothe
words
of
almaalma


nevertheless
alma
labored
much
in
the
spirit
wrestling
withgod
in
mighty
prayer
that
he
would
pour
out
his
spirit
upon
thepeople
who
were
in
the
city
that
he
would
also
grant
that
hemight
baptize
them
unto
repentancealma


nevertheless
they
hardened
their
hearts
saying
unto
himbehold
we
know
that
thou
art
alma
and
we
know
that
thou
arthigh
priest
over
the
church
which
thou
hast
established
in
manyparts
of
the
land
according
to
your
tradition
and
we
are
not
ofthy
church
and
we
do
not
believe
in
such
foolish
traditionsalma


and
now
we
know
that
because
we
are
not
of
thy
church
we
knowthat
thou
hast
no
power
over
us
and
thou
hast
delivered
up
thejudgmentseat
unto
nephihah
therefore
thou
art
not
the
chiefjudge
over
usalma


now
when
the
people
had
said
this
and
withstood
all
hiswords
and
reviled
him
and
spit
upon
him
and
caused
that
heshould
be
cast
out
of
their
city
he
departed
thence
and
took
hisjourney
towards
the
city
which
was
called
aaronalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
he
was
journeying
thitherbeing
weighed
down
with
sorrow
wading
through
much
tribulationand
anguish
of
soul
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
whowere
in
the
city
of
ammonihah
it
came
to
pass
while
alma
wasthus
weighed
down
with
sorrow
behold
an
angel
of
the
lordappeared
unto
him
sayingalma


blessed
art
thou

therefore

up
thy

for
thou
hast
great
cause
to
rejoice
for
thou
hast
beenfaithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of

from
the
time
whichthou
receivedst
thy
first
message
from

behold
I

it
unto

and
behold
I
am

to

thee
that

preach
unto
them

yea
say
unto
them

destroy

for
behold
they
do
study
at
this
time
that
they
may
destroythe
liberty
of

people
for
thus
saith
the
lord
which
iscontrary
to
the
statutes
and
judgments
and
commandments
whichhe
has
given
unto
his
peoplealma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
alma
had
received
his
messagefrom
the
angel
of
the
lord
he
returned
speedily
to
the
land
ofammonihah

and
he
entered
the
city
by
another
way
yea
by
theway
which
is
on
the
south
of
the
city
of
ammonihahalma


and
as
he
entered
the
city
he
was
an
hungered
and
he
said
toa
man
will
ye
give
to
an
humble
servant
of
god
something
to
eatalma


and
the
man
said
unto
him
I
am
a
nephite
and
I
know
thatthou
art
a
holy
prophet
of

for
thou
art
the
man

Iknow
that
thou
wilt
be
a
blessing
unto
me
and

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
man

the
man

called

he
brought

and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
ate
bread
and
was
filled

blessed
amulek
and
his
house
and
he
gave
thanks
unto
godalma


and
after
he
had
eaten
and
was
filled
he
said
unto
amulek
Iam
alma
and
am
the
high
priest
over
the
church
of

and
behold
I
have
been
called
to
preach
the
word
of
godamong
all
this
people
according
to
the
spirit
of
revelation
andprophecy
and
I
was
in
this
land
and
they
would
not
receive
mebut
they
cast
me
out
and
I
was
about
to
set
my
back
towards

foreveralma


but
behold
I
have
been
commanded
that
I
should
turn

and
to
testify
against

their
iniquitiesalma


and
now
amulek
because
thou
hast
fed
me
and
taken
me
inthou
art
blessed
for
I
was
an
hungered
for
I
had
fasted
manydaysalma


and
alma
tarried
many
days
with
amulek
before
he
began
topreach
unto
the
peoplealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
did
wax
more
gross
intheir
iniquitiesalma


and
the
word
came
to
alma
saying
go

also
say
unto

except
ye

Iwill

in
mine
anger

and
I
will
not

anger

and
alma
went
forth
and
also
amulek
among
the
people
todeclare
the
words
of
god
unto
them
and
they
were
filled
with
theholy
ghostalma


and
they
had
power
given
unto
them
insomuch
that
they
couldnot
be
confined
in
dungeons
neither
was
it
possible
that
any
mancould
slay
them
nevertheless
they
did
not
exercise
their
poweruntil
they
were
bound
in
bands
and
cast
into
prison

now
thiswas
done
that
the
lord
might
show
forth
his
power
in
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
forth
and
began
to
preachand
to
prophesy
unto
the
people
according
to
the
spirit
andpower

the

had
given

alma


and
again
I
alma
having
been
commanded
of
god
that
I
shouldtake
amulek
and
go
forth
and
preach
again
unto
this
people
orthe
people
who
were
in
the
city
of
ammonihah
it
came
to
pass
asI
began
to
preach
unto
them
they
began
to
contend
with
mesayingalma


who
art
thou

suppose
ye
that
we
shall
believe
the
testimonyof
one
man
although
he
should
preach
unto
us
that
the
earthshould
pass
awayalma


now
they
understood
not
the
words
which
they
spake
for
theyknew
not
that
the
earth
should
pass
awayalma


and
they
said
also
we
will
not
believe
thy
words
if
thoushouldst
prophesy
that
this
great
city
should
be
destroyed
in
onedayalma


now
they
knew
not
that
god
could
do
such
marvelous
works
forthey
were
a
hardhearted
and
a
stiffnecked
peoplealma


and
they
said
who
is
god
that
sendeth
no
more
authority
thanone
man
among
this
people
to
declare
unto
them
the
truth
of
suchgreat
and
marvelous
thingsalma


and
they
stood
forth
to
lay
their
hands
on
me
but
beholdthey
did
not

and
I
stood
with
boldness
to
declare
unto
themyea
I
did
boldly
testify
unto
them
sayingalma


behold
o
ye
wicked
and
perverse
generation
how
have
yeforgotten
the
tradition
of
your
fathers
yea
how
soon
ye
haveforgotten
the
commandments
of
godalma


do
ye
not
remember
that
our
father
lehi
was
brought
out
ofjerusalem
by
the
hand
of
god

do
ye
not
remember
that
they
wereall
led
by
him
through
the
wildernessalma


and
have
ye
forgotten
so
soon
how
many
times
he
delivered
ourfathers
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
and
preserved
themfrom
being
destroyed
even
by
the
hands
of
their
own
brethrenalma


yea
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
matchless
power
and
hismercy
and
his
longsuffering
towards
us
we
should
unavoidablyhave
been
cut
off
from
the
face
of
the
earth
long
before
thisperiod
of
time
and
perhaps
been
consigned
to
a
state
of
endlessmisery
and
woealma


behold
now
I
say
unto
you
that
he
commandeth
you
to
repentand
except
ye
repent
ye
can
in
nowise
inherit
the
kingdom
ofgod

but
behold
this
is
not
allhe
has
commanded
you
torepent
or
he
will
utterly
destroy
you
from
off
the
face
of
theearth
yea
he
will
visit
you
in
his
anger
and
in
his
fierceanger
he
will
not
turn
awayalma


behold
do
ye
not
remember
the
words
which
he
spake
untolehi
saying
that
Inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
yeshall
prosper
in
the
land

and
again
it
is
said
that
Inasmuchas
ye
will
not
keep
my
commandments
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
thepresence
of
the
lordalma


now
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
inasmuch
as
thelamanites
have
not
kept
the
commandments
of
god
they
have
beencut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord

now
we
see
that
the
wordof
the
lord
has
been
verified
in
this
thing
and
the
lamaniteshave
been
cut
off
from
his
presence
from
the
beginning
of
theirtransgressions
in
the
landalma


nevertheless
I
say
unto
you
that
it
shall
be
more
tolerablefor
them
in
the
day
of
judgment
than
for
you
if
ye
remain
inyour
sins
yea
and
even
more
tolerable
for
them
in
this
lifethan
for
you
except
ye
repentalma


for
there
are
many
promises
which
are
extended
to
thelamanites
for
it
is
because
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathersthat
caused
them
to
remain
in
their
state
of
ignorance
thereforethe
lord
will
be
merciful
unto
them
and
prolong
their
existencein
the
landalma


and
at
some
period
of
time
they
will
be
brought
to
believe
inhis
word
and
to
know
of
the
incorrectness
of
the
traditions
oftheir
fathers
and
many
of
them
will
be
saved
for
the
lord
willbe
merciful
unto
all
who
call
on
his
namealma


but
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
persist
in
yourwickedness
that
your
days
shall
not
be
prolonged
in
the
land
forthe
lamanites
shall
be
sent
upon
you
and
if
ye
repent
not
theyshall
come
in
a
time
when
you
know
not
and
ye
shall
be
visitedwith
utter
destruction
and
it
shall
be
according
to
the
fierceanger
of
the
lordalma


for
he
will
not
suffer
you
that
ye
shall
live
in
youriniquities
to
destroy
his
people

I
say
unto
you
nay
he
wouldrather
suffer
that
the
lamanites
might
destroy
all
his
people
whoare
called
the
people
of
nephi
if
it
were
possible
that
theycould
fall
into
sins
and
transgressions
after
having
had
so
muchlight
and
so
much
knowledge
given
unto
them
of
the
lord
theirgodalma


yea
after
having
been
such
a
highly
favored
people
of
thelord
yea
after
having
been
favored
above
every
other
nationkindred
tongue
or
people
after
having
had
all
things
madeknown
unto
them
according
to
their
desires
and
their
faith
andprayers
of
that
which
has
been
and
which
is
and
which
is
tocomealma


having
been
visited
by
the
spirit
of
god
having
conversedwith
angels
and
having
been
spoken
unto
by
the
voice
of
thelord
and
having
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
the
spirit
ofrevelation
and
also
many
gifts
the
gift
of
speaking
withtongues
and
the
gift
of

and
the
gift

the
gift

yea
and
after
having
been
delivered
of
god
out
of
the
landof
jerusalem
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
having
been
saved
fromfamine
and
from
sickness
and
all
manner
of

they

waxed
strong
in

having
been

preserved

now
and
they
have
beenprospered
until
they
are
rich
in
all
manner
of
thingsalma


and
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
if
this
people
who
havereceived
so
many
blessings
from
the
hand
of
the
lord
shouldtransgress
contrary
to
the
light
and
knowledge
which
they
dohave
I
say
unto
you
that
if
this
be
the
case
that
if
theyshould
fall
into
transgression
it
would
be
far
more
tolerablefor
the
lamanites
than
for
themalma


for
behold
the
promises
of
the
lord
are
extended
to
thelamanites
but
they
are
not
unto
you
if
ye
transgress
for
hasnot
the
lord
expressly
promised
and
firmly
decreed
that
if
yewill
rebel
against
him
that
ye
shall
utterly
be
destroyed
fromoff
the
face
of
the
earthalma


and
now
for
this
cause
that
ye
may
not
be
destroyed
thelord
has
sent
his
angel
to
visit
many
of
his
people
declaringunto
them
that
they
must
go
forth
and
cry
mightily
unto
thispeople
saying
repent
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
nigh
athandalma


and
not
many
days
hence
the
son
of
god
shall
come
in
hisglory
and
his
glory
shall
be
the
glory
of
the
only
begotten
ofthe
father
full
of
grace
equity
and
truth
full
of
patiencemercy
and
longsuffering
quick
to
hear
the
cries
of
his
peopleand
to
answer
their
prayersalma


and
behold
he
cometh
to
redeem
those
who
will
be
baptizedunto
repentance
through
faith
on
his
namealma


therefore
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
for
the
time
is
athand
that
all
men
shall
reap
a
reward
of
their
works
accordingto
that
which
they
have
beenif
they
have
been
righteous
theyshall
reap
the
salvation
of
their
souls
according
to
the
powerand
deliverance
of
jesus
christ
and
if
they
have
been
evil
theyshall
reap
the
damnation
of
their
souls
according
to
the
powerand
captivation
of
the
devilalma


now
behold
this
is
the
voice
of
the
angel
crying
unto
thepeoplealma


and
now
my
beloved
brethren
for
ye
are
my
brethren
and
yeought
to
be
beloved
and
ye
ought
to
bring
forth
works
which
aremeet
for
repentance
seeing
that
your
hearts
have
been
grosslyhardened
against
the
word
of
god
and
seeing
that
ye
are
a
lostand
a
fallen
peoplealma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
alma
had
spoken
thesewords
behold
the
people
were
wroth
with
me
because
I
said
untothem
that
they
were
a
hardhearted
and
a
stiffnecked
peoplealma


and
also
because
I
said
unto
them
that
they
were
a
lost
and
afallen
people
they
were
angry
with
me
and
sought
to
lay
theirhands
upon
me
that
they
might
cast
me
into
prisonalma


but
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
not
suffer
them
thatthey
should
take
me
at
that
time
and
cast
me
into
prisonalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
amulek
went
and
stood
forth
andbegan
to
preach
unto
them
also

and
now
the
words
of
amulek
arenot
all
written
nevertheless
a
part
of
his
words
are
written
inthis
bookalma
chapter
alma


now
these
are
the
words
which
amulek
preached
unto
the
peoplewho
were
in
the
land
of
ammonihah
sayingalma


I
am
amulek
I
am
the
son
of
giddonah
who
was
the
son
ofIshmael
who
was
a
descendant
of
aminadi
and
it
was
the
sameaminadi
who
interpreted
the
writing
which
was
upon
the
wall
ofthe
temple
which
was
written
by
the
finger
of
godalma


and
aminadi
was
a
descendant
of
nephi
who
was
the
son
oflehi
who
came
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
who
was
a
descendantof
manasseh
who
was
the
son
of
joseph
who
was
sold
into
egypt
bythe
hands
of
his
brethrenalma


and
behold
I
am
also
a
man
of
no
small
reputation
among
allthose
who
know
me
yea
and
behold
I
have
many
kindreds
andfriends
and
I
have
also
acquired
much
riches
by
the
hand
of
myindustryalma


nevertheless
after
all
this
I
never
have
known
much
of
theways
of
the
lord
and
his
mysteries
and
marvelous
power

I
saidI
never
had
known
much
of
these
things
but
behold
I
mistakefor
I
have
seen
much
of
his
mysteries
and
his
marvelous
poweryea
even
in
the
preservation
of
the
lives
of
this
peoplealma


nevertheless
I
did
harden
my
heart
for
I
was
called
manytimes
and
I
would
not
hear
therefore
I
knew
concerning
thesethings
yet
I
would
not
know
therefore
I
went
on
rebellingagainst
god
in
the
wickedness
of
my
heart
even
until
the
fourthday
of
this
seventh
month
which
is
in
the
tenth
year
of
thereign
of
the
judgesalma


as
I
was
journeying
to
see
a
very
near
kindred
behold
anangel
of
the
lord
appeared
unto
me
and
said
amulek
return
tothine
own
house
for
thou
shalt
feed
a
prophet
of
the
lord
yeaa
holy
man
who
is
a
chosen
man
of
god
for
he
has
fasted
manydays
because
of
the
sins
of
this
people
and
he
is
an
hungeredand
thou
shalt
receive
him
into
thy
house
and
feed
him
and
heshall
bless
thee
and
thy
house
and
the
blessing
of
the
lordshall
rest
upon
thee
and
thy
housealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
angel
andreturned
towards
my
house

and
as
I
was
going
thither
I
foundthe
man
whom
the
angel
said
unto
me
thou
shalt
receive
into
thyhouseand
behold
it
was
this
same
man
who
has
been
speaking
untoyou
concerning
the
things
of
godalma


and
the
angel
said
unto
me
he
is
a
holy
man
wherefore
I
knowhe
is
a
holy
man
because
it
was
said
by
an
angel
of
godalma


and
again
I
know
that
the
things
whereof
he
hath
testifiedare
true
for
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
as
the
lord
livetheven
so
has
he
sent
his
angel
to
make
these
things
manifest
untome
and
this
he
has
done
while
this
alma
hath
dwelt
at
my
housealma


for
behold
he
hath
blessed
mine
house
he
hath
blessed
meand
my
women
and
my
children
and
my
father
and
my
kinsfolkyea
even
all
my
kindred
hath
he
blessed
and
the
blessing
of
thelord
hath
rested
upon
us
according
to
the
words
which
he
spakealma


and
now
when
amulek
had
spoken
these
words
the
people
beganto
be
astonished
seeing
there
was
more
than
one
witness
whotestified
of
the
things
whereof
they
were
accused
and
also
ofthe
things
which
were
to
come
according
to
the
spirit
ofprophecy
which
was
in
themalma


nevertheless
there
were
some
among
them
who
thought
toquestion
them
that
by
their
cunning
devices
they
might
catchthem
in
their
words
that
they
might
find
witness
against
themthat
they
might
deliver
them
to
their
judges
that
they
might
bejudged
according
to
the
law
and
that
they
might
be
slain
or
castinto
prison
according
to
the
crime
which
they
could
make
appearor
witness
against
themalma


now
it
was
those
men
who
sought
to
destroy
them
who
werelawyers
who
were
hired
or
appointed
by
the
people
to
administerthe
law
at
their
times
of
trials
or
at
the
trials
of
the
crimesof
the
people
before
the
judgesalma


now
these
lawyers
were
learned
in
all
the
arts
and
cunning
ofthe
people
and
this
was
to
enable
them
that
they
might
beskilful
in
their
professionalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
question
amulek
thatthereby
they
might
make
him
cross
his
words
or
contradict
thewords
which
he
should
speakalma


now
they
knew
not
that
amulek
could
know
of
their
designs
but
it
came
to
pass
as
they
began
to
question
him
he
perceivedtheir
thoughts
and
he
said
unto
them
o
ye
wicked
and
perversegeneration
ye
lawyers
and
hypocrites
for
ye
are
laying
thefoundation
of
the
devil
for
ye
are
laying
traps
and
snares
tocatch
the
holy
ones
of
godalma


ye
are
laying
plans
to
pervert
the
ways
of
the
righteous
andto
bring
down
the
wrath
of
god
upon
your
heads
even
to
the
utterdestruction
of
this
peoplealma


yea
well
did
mosiah
say
who
was
our
last
king
when
he
wasabout
to
deliver
up
the
kingdom
having
no
one
to
confer
it
uponcausing
that
this
people
should
be
governed
by
their
ownvoicesyea
well
did
he
say
that
if
the
time
should
come

voice
of
this

should
choose
iniquity
that
is
if
thetime
should
come
that
this
people
should
fall
into
transgressionthey
would
be
ripe
for
destructionalma


and
now
I
say
unto
you
that
well
doth
the
lord
judge
of
youriniquities
well
doth
he
cry
unto
this
people
by
the
voice
ofhis
angels
repent
ye
repent
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven

athandalma


yea
well
doth
he
cry
by
the
voice
of
his
angels
that
Iwill
come
down
among
my
people
with
equity
and
justice

yea
and
I
say
unto
you
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
prayersof
the
righteous
who
are
now
in
the
land
that
ye
would
even
nowbe
visited
with
utter
destruction
yet
it
would
not
be
by
floodas
were
the
people
in
the
days
of
noah
but
it
would
be
byfamine
and
by
pestilence
and
the
swordalma


but
it
is
by
the
prayers
of
the
righteous
that
ye
are
sparednow
therefore
if
ye
will
cast
out
the
righteous
from
among
youthen
will
not
the
lord
stay
his
hand
but
in
his
fierce
anger
hewill
come
out
against
you
then
ye
shall
be
smitten
by
famineand
by
pestilence
and
by
the
sword
and
the
time
is
soon
at
handexcept
ye
repentalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
were
more
angry
withamulek
and
they
cried
out
saying
this
man
doth
revile
againstour
laws
which
are
just
and
our
wise
lawyers
whom
we
haveselectedalma


but
amulek
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
cried
the
mightierunto
them
saying
o
ye
wicked
and
perverse
generation
why
hathsatan
got
such
great
hold
upon
your
hearts

why
will
ye
yieldyourselves
unto
him
that
he
may
have
power
over
you
to
blindyour
eyes
that
ye
will
not
understand
the
words
which
arespoken
according
to
their
truthalma


for
behold
have
I
testified
against
your
law

ye
do
notunderstand
ye
say
that
I
have
spoken
against
your
law
but
Ihave
not
but
I
have
spoken
in
favor
of
your
law
to
yourcondemnationalma


and
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
the
foundation
of
thedestruction
of
this
people
is
beginning
to
be
laid
by
theunrighteousness
of
your
lawyers
and
your
judgesalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
amulek
had
spoken
thesewords
the
people
cried
out
against
him
saying
now
we
know
thatthis
man
is
a
child
of
the
devil
for
he
hath
lied
unto
us
forhe
hath
spoken
against
our
law

and
now
he
says
that
he
has
notspoken
against
italma


and
again
he
has
reviled
against
our
lawyers
and
ourjudgesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lawyers
put
it
into
their
heartsthat
they
should
remember
these
things
against
himalma


and
there
was
one
among
them
whose
name
was
zeezrom

now
hewas
the
foremost
to
accuse
amulek
and
alma
he
being
one
of
themost
expert
among
them
having
much
business
to
do
among
thepeoplealma


now
the
object
of
these
lawyers
was
to
get
gain
and
they
gotgain
according
to
their
employalma
chapter
alma


now
it
was
in
the
law
of
mosiah
that
every
man
who
was
a
judgeof
the
law
or
those
who
were
appointed
to
be
judges
shouldreceive
wages
according
to
the
time
which
they
labored
to
judgethose
who
were
brought
before
them
to
be
judgedalma


now
if
a
man
owed
another
and
he
would
not
pay
that
which
hedid
owe
he
was
complained
of
to
the
judge
and
the
judgeexecuted
authority
and
sent
forth
officers
that
the
man
shouldbe
brought
before
him
and
he
judged
the
man
according
to
the
lawand
the
evidences
which
were
brought
against
him
and
thus
theman
was
compelled
to
pay
that
which
he
owed
or
be
stripped
orbe
cast
out
from
among
the
people
as
a
thief

a
robberalma


and
the
judge
received
for
his
wages
according

his
timeasenine
of
gold
for
a

a
senum
of
silver
which
is
equal
toa
senine
of

this
is
according
to
the
law

wasgivenalma


now
these
are
the
names
of
the
different
pieces
of
their
goldand
of
their
silver
according
to
their
value

and
the
names
aregiven
by
the
nephites
for
they
did
not
reckon
after
the
mannerof
the
jews
who
were
at
jerusalem
neither
did
they
measure
afterthe
manner
of
the
jews
but
they
altered
their
reckoning
andtheir
measure
according
to
the
minds
and
the
circumstances
ofthe
people
in
every
generation
until
the
reign
of
the

been
established

also
for

now
the

an

now
it
was
for
the
sole
purpose
to
get
gain
because
theyreceived
their
wages
according

therefore
theydid
stir
up
the
people
to
riotings

all

ofdisturbances
and
wickedness
that
they
might
have
more
employthat
they
might
get
money
according

werebrought
before
them
therefore
they
did
stir
up
the
peopleagainst
alma
and
amulekalma


and
this
zeezrom
began
to
question
amulek
saying
will
yeanswer
me
a
few
questions
which
I
shall
ask
you

now
zeezrom
wasa
man
who
was
expert
in
the
devices
of
the
devil
that
he
mightdestroy
that
which
was
good
therefore
he
said
unto
amulek
willye
answer
the
questions
which
I
shall
put
unto
youalma


and
amulek
said
unto
him
yea
if
it
be
according
to
thespirit
of
the
lord
which
is
in
me
for
I
shall
say
nothing
whichis
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
lord

and
zeezrom
said
untohim
behold
here
are
six
onties
of
silver
and
all
these
will
Igive
thee
if
thou
wilt
deny
the
existence
of
a
supreme
beingalma


now
amulek
said
o
thou
child
of
hell
why
tempt
ye
me
knowest
thou
that
the
righteous
yieldeth
to
no
such
temptationsalma


believest
thou
that
there
is
no
god

I
say
unto
you
naythou
knowest
that
there
is
a
god
but
thou
lovest
that
lucre
morethan
himalma


and
now
thou
hast
lied
before
god
unto
me

thou
saidst
untomebehold
these
six
onties
which
are
of
great
worth
I
willgive
unto
theewhen
thou
hadst
it
in
thy
heart
to
retain
themfrom
me
and
it
was
only
thy
desire
that
I
should
deny
the
trueand
living
god
that
thou
mightest
have
cause
to
destroy
me

andnow
behold
for
this
great
evil
thou
shalt
have
thy
rewardalma


and
zeezrom
said
unto
him
thou
sayest
there
is
a
true
andliving
godalma


and
amulek
said
yea
there
is
a
true
and
living
godalma


now
zeezrom
said
Is
there
more
than
one
godalma


and
he
answered
noalma


now
zeezrom
said
unto
him
again
how
knowest
thou
thesethingsalma


and
he
said
an
angel
hath
made
them
known
unto
mealma


and
zeezrom
said
again
who
is
he
that
shall
come

Is
it
theson
of
godalma


and
he
said
unto
him
yeaalma


and
zeezrom
said
again
shall
he
save
his
people
in
theirsins

and
amulek
answered
and
said
unto
him
I
say
unto
you
heshall
not
for
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
deny
his
wordalma


now
zeezrom
said
unto
the
people
see
that
ye
remember
thesethings
for
he
said
there
is
but
one
god
yet
he
saith
that
theson
of
god
shall
come
but
he
shall
not
save
his
peopleasthough
he
had
authority
to
command
godalma


now
amulek
saith
again
unto
him
behold
thou
hast
lied
forthou
sayest
that
I
spake
as
though
I
had
authority
to
command
godbecause
I
said
he
shall
not
save
his
people
in
their
sinsalma


and
I
say
unto
you
again
that
he
cannot
save
them
in
theirsins
for
I
cannot
deny
his
word
and
he
hath
said
that
nounclean
thing
can
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven
therefore
howcan
ye
be
saved
except
ye
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven
therefore
ye
cannot
be
saved
in
your
sinsalma


now
zeezrom
saith
again
unto
him
Is
the
son
of
god
the
veryeternal
fatheralma


and
amulek
said
unto
him
yea
he
is
the
very
eternal
fatherof
heaven
and
of
earth
and
all
things
which
in
them
are
he
isthe
beginning
and
the
end
the
first
and
the
lastalma


and
he
shall
come
into
the
world
to
redeem
his
people
and
heshall
take
upon
him
the
transgressions
of
those
who
believe
onhis
name
and
these
are
they
that
shall
have
eternal
life
andsalvation
cometh
to
none
elsealma


therefore
the
wicked
remain
as
though
there
had
been
noredemption
made
except
it
be
the
loosing
of
the
bands
of
deathfor
behold
the
day
cometh
that
all
shall
rise
from
the
dead
andstand
before
god
and
be
judged
according
to
their
worksalma


now
there
is
a
death
which
is
called
a
temporal
death

death
of
christ
shall
loose
the
bands
of
this
temporal
deaththat
all

the

whether
they

good
or
whether
they

now
behold
I
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
the
death
ofthe
mortal
body
and
also
concerning
the
resurrection
of
themortal
body

I
say
unto
you
that
this
mortal
body
is
raised
toan
immortal
body
that
is
from
death
even
from
the
first

life

they
can

uniting
withtheir
bodies
never
to
be
divided
thus
the
whole
becomingspiritual
and
immortal
that
they
can
no
more
see
corruptionalma


now
when
amulek
had
finished
these
words
the
people
beganagain
to
be
astonished
and
also
zeezrom
began
to
tremble

andthus
ended
the
words
of
amulek
or
this
is
all
that
I
havewrittenalma
chapter
alma


now
alma
seeing
that
the
words
of
amulek
had
silencedzeezrom
for
he
beheld
that
amulek
had
caught
him
in
his
lyingand
deceiving
to
destroy
him
and
seeing
that
he
began
to
trembleunder
a
consciousness
of
his
guilt
he
opened
his
mouth
and
beganto
speak
unto
him
and
to
establish
the
words
of
amulek
and
toexplain
things
beyond
or
to
unfold
the
scriptures
beyond
thatwhich
amulek
had
donealma


now
the
words
that
alma
spake
unto
zeezrom
were
heard
by
thepeople
round
about
for
the
multitude
was
great
and
he
spake
onthis
wisealma


now
zeezrom
seeing
that
thou
hast
been
taken
in
thy
lying
andcraftiness
for
thou
hast
not
lied
unto
men
only
but
thou
hastlied
unto
god
for
behold
he
knows
all
thy
thoughts
and
thouseest
that
thy
thoughts
are
made
known
unto
us
by
his
spiritalma


and
thou
seest
that
we
know
that
thy
plan
was
a
very
subtleplan
as
to
the
subtlety
of
the
devil
for
to
lie
and
to
deceivethis
people
that
thou
mightest
set
them
against
us
to
revile
usand
to
cast
us
outalma


now
this
was
a
plan
of
thine
adversary
and
he
hath
exercisedhis
power
in
thee

now
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
whatI
say
unto
thee
I
say
unto
allalma


and
behold
I
say
unto
you
all
that
this
was
a
snare
of
theadversary
which
he
has
laid
to
catch
this
people
that
he
mightbring
you
into
subjection
unto
him
that
he
might
encircle
youabout
with
his
chains
that
he
might
chain
you
down
toeverlasting
destruction
according
to
the
power
of
his
captivityalma


now
when
alma
had
spoken
these
words
zeezrom
began
to
tremblemore
exceedingly
for
he
was
convinced
more
and
more
of
the
powerof
god
and
he
was
also
convinced
that
alma
and
amulek
had
aknowledge
of
him
for
he
was
convinced
that
they
knew
thethoughts
and
intents
of
his
heart
for
power
was
given
unto
themthat
they
might
know
of
these
things
according
to
the
spirit
ofprophecyalma


and
zeezrom
began
to
inquire
of
them
diligently
that
he
mightknow
more
concerning
the
kingdom
of
god

and
he
said
unto
almawhat
does
this
mean
which
amulek
hath
spoken
concerning
theresurrection
of
the
dead
that
all
shall
rise
from
the
dead
boththe
just
and
the
unjust
and
are
brought
to
stand
before
god
tobe
judged
according
to
their
worksalma


and
now
alma
began
to
expound
these
things
unto
him
sayingIt
is
given
unto
many
to
know
the
mysteries
of
god
neverthelessthey
are
laid
under
a
strict
command
that
they
shall
not
impartonly
according
to
the
portion
of
his
word
which
he
doth
grantunto
the
children
of
men
according
to
the
heed
and
diligencewhich
they
give
unto
himalma


and
therefore
he
that
will
harden
his
heart
the
samereceiveth
the
lesser
portion
of
the
word
and
he
that
will
notharden
his
heart
to
him
is
given
the
greater
portion
of
theword
until
it
is
given
unto
him
to
know
the
mysteries
of
goduntil
he
know
them
in
fullalma


and
they
that
will
harden
their
hearts
to
them
is
given
thelesser
portion
of
the
word
until
they
know
nothing
concerning
hismysteries
and
then
they
are
taken
captive
by
the
devil
and
ledby
his
will
down
to
destruction

now
this
is
what
is
meant
bythe
chains
of
hellalma


and
amulek
hath
spoken
plainly
concerning
death
and
beingraised
from
this
mortality
to
a
state
of
immortality
and
beingbrought
before
the
bar
of
god
to
be
judged
according
to
ourworksalma


then
if
our
hearts
have
been
hardened
yea
if
we
havehardened
our
hearts
against
the
word
insomuch
that
it
has
notbeen
found
in
us
then
will
our
state
be
awful
for
then
we
shallbe
condemnedalma


for
our
words
will
condemn
us
yea
all
our
works
willcondemn
us
we
shall
not
be
found
spotless
and
our
thoughts
willalso
condemn
us
and
in
this
awful
state
we
shall
not
dare
tolook
up
to
our
god
and
we
would
fain
be
glad
if
we
could
commandthe
rocks
and
the
mountains
to
fall
upon
us
to
hide
us
from
hispresencealma


but
this
cannot
be
we
must
come
forth
and
stand
before
himin
his
glory
and
in
his
power
and
in
his
might
majesty
anddominion
and
acknowledge
to
our
everlasting
shame
that
all
hisjudgments
are
just
that
he
is
just
in
all
his
works
and
that
heis
merciful
unto
the
children
of
men
and
that
he
has
all
powerto
save
every
man
that
believeth
on
his
name
and
bringeth
forthfruit
meet
for
repentancealma


and
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
then
cometh
a
death
even
asecond
death
which
is
a
spiritual
death
then
is
a
time
thatwhosoever
dieth
in
his
sins
as
to
a
temporal
death
shall
alsodie
a
spiritual
death
yea
he
shall
die
as
to
things
pertainingunto
righteousnessalma


then
is
the
time
when
their
torments
shall
be
as
a
lake
offire
and
brimstone
whose
flame
ascendeth
up
forever
and
everand
then
is
the
time
that
they
shall
be
chained
down
to
aneverlasting
destruction
according
to
the
power
and
captivity
ofsatan
he
having
subjected
them
according
to
his
willalma


then
I
say
unto
you
they
shall
be
as
though
there
had
beenno
redemption
made
for
they
cannot
be
redeemed
according
togods
justice
and
they
cannot
die
seeing
there
is
no
morecorruptionalma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
alma
had
made
an
end
ofspeaking
these
words
the
people
began
to
be
more
astonishedalma


but
there
was
one
antionah
who
was
a
chief
ruler
among
themcame
forth
and
said
unto
him
what
is
this
that
thou
hast
saidthat
man
should
rise
from
the
dead
and
be
changed
from
thismortal
to
an
immortal
state
that
the
soul
can
never
diealma


what
does
the
scripture
mean
which
saith
that
god
placedcherubim
and
a
flaming
sword
on
the
east
of
the
garden
of
edenlest
our
first
parents
should
enter
and
partake
of
the
fruit
ofthe
tree
of
life
and
live
forever

and
thus
we
see
that
therewas
no
possible
chance
that
they
should
live
foreveralma


now
alma
said
unto
him

this
is
the
thing
which
I
was
aboutto
explain
now
we
see
that
adam
did
fall
by
the
partaking
of
theforbidden
fruit
according
to
the
word
of
god
and
thus
we
seethat
by
his
fall
all
mankind
became
a
lost
and
fallen
peoplealma


and
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
if
it
had
been
possiblefor
adam
to
have
partaken
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
atthat
time
there
would
have
been
no
death
and
the
word
wouldhave
been
void
making
god
a
liar
for
he
said
If
thou
eat
thoushalt
surely
diealma


and
we
see
that
death
comes
upon
mankind
yea
the
deathwhich
has
been
spoken
of
by
amulek
which
is
the
temporal
deathnevertheless
there
was
a
space
granted
unto
man
in
which
he
mightrepent
therefore
this
life
became
a
probationary
state
a
timeto
prepare
to
meet
god
a
time
to
prepare
for
that
endless
statewhich
has
been
spoken
of
by
us
which
is
after
the
resurrectionof
the
deadalma


now
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
plan
of
redemption
which
waslaid
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
there
could
have
been
noresurrection
of
the
dead
but
there
was
a
plan
of
redemptionlaid
which
shall
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
ofwhich
has
been
spokenalma


and
now
behold
if
it
were
possible
that
our
first
parentscould
have
gone
forth
and
partaken
of
the
tree
of
life
they
wouldhave
been
forever
miserable
having
no
preparatory
state
andthus
the
plan
of
redemption
would
have
been
frustrated
and
theword
of
god
would
have
been
void
taking
none
effectalma


but
behold
it
was
not
so
but
it
was
appointed
unto
men
thatthey
must
die
and
after
death
they
must
come
to
judgment
eventhat
same
judgment
of
which
we
have
spoken
which
is
the
endalma


and
after
god
had
appointed
that
these
things
should
comeunto
man
behold
then
he
saw
that
it
was
expedient
that
manshould
know
concerning
the
things
whereof
he
had
appointed
untothemalma


therefore
he
sent
angels
to
converse
with
them
who
causedmen
to
behold
of
his
gloryalma


and
they
began
from
that
time
forth
to
call
on
his
nametherefore
god
conversed
with
men
and
made
known
unto
them
theplan
of
redemption
which
had
been
prepared
from
the
foundationof
the
world
and
this
he
made
known
unto
them
according
to
theirfaith
and
repentance
and
their
holy
worksalma


wherefore
he
gave
commandments
unto
men
they
having
firsttransgressed
the
first
commandments
as
to
things
which
weretemporal
and
becoming
as
gods
knowing
good
from
evil
placingthemselves
in
a
state
to
act
or
being
placed
in
a
state
to
actaccording
to
their
wills
and
pleasures
whether
to
do
evil
or
todo
goodalma


therefore
god
gave
unto
them
commandments
after
having
madeknown
unto
them
the
plan
of
redemption
that
they
should
not
doevil
the
penalty
thereof
being
a
second
death
which
was
aneverlasting
death
as
to
things
pertaining
unto
righteousness
foron
such
the
plan
of
redemption
could
have
no
power
for
the
worksof
justice
could
not
be
destroyed
according
to
the
supremegoodness
of
godalma


but
god
did
call
on
men
in
the
name
of
his
son
this
beingthe
plan
of
redemption
which
was
laid
saying
If
ye
will
repentand
harden
not
your
hearts
then
will
I
have
mercy
upon
youthrough
mine
only
begotten
sonalma


therefore
whosoever
repenteth
and
hardeneth
not
his
hearthe
shall
have
claim
on
mercy
through
mine
only
begotten
son
untoa
remission
of
his
sins
and
these
shall
enter
into
my
restalma


and
whosoever
will
harden
his
heart
and
will
do
iniquitybehold
I
swear
in
my
wrath
that
he
shall
not
enter
into
my
restalma


and
now
my
brethren
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
if
ye
willharden
your
hearts
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
lordtherefore
your
iniquity
provoketh
him
that
he
sendeth
down
hiswrath
upon
you
as
in
the
first
provocation
yea
according
to
hisword
in
the
last
provocation
as
well
as
the
first
to
theeverlasting
destruction
of
your
souls
therefore
according
tohis
word
unto
the
last
death
as
well
as
the
firstalma


and
now
my
brethren
seeing
we
know
these
things
and
theyare
true
let
us
repent
and
harden
not
our
hearts
that
weprovoke
not
the
lord
our
god
to
pull
down
his
wrath
upon
us
inthese
his
second
commandments
which
he
has
given
unto
us
but
letus
enter
into
the
rest
of
god
which
is
prepared
according
to
hiswordalma
chapter
alma


and
again
my
brethren
I
would
cite
your
minds
forward
to
thetime
when
the
lord
god
gave
these
commandments
unto
his
childrenand
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
the
lord
god
ordainedpriests
after
his
holy
order
which
was
after
the
order
of
hisson
to
teach
these
things
unto
the
peoplealma


and
those
priests
were
ordained
after
the
order
of
his
son
ina
manner
that
thereby
the
people
might
know
in
what
manner
tolook
forward
to
his
son
for
redemptionalma


and
this
is
the
manner
after
which
they
were
ordainedbeingcalled
and
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
according
tothe
foreknowledge
of
god
on
account
of
their
exceeding
faith
andgood
works
in
the
first
place
being
left
to
choose
good
or
eviltherefore
they
having
chosen
good
and
exercising
exceedinglygreat
faith
are
called
with
a
holy
calling
yea
with
that
holycalling
which
was
prepared
with
and
according
to
a
preparatoryredemption
for
suchalma


and
thus
they
have
been
called
to
this
holy
calling
on
accountof
their
faith
while
others
would
reject
the
spirit
of
god
onaccount
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
blindness
of
theirminds
while
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
they
might
have
had
asgreat
privilege
as
their
brethrenalma


or
in
fine
in
the
first
place
they
were
on
the
same
standingwith
their
brethren
thus
this
holy
calling
being
prepared
fromthe
foundation
of
the
world
for
such
as
would
not
harden
theirhearts
being
in
and
through
the
atonement
of
the
only
begottenson
who
was
preparedalma


and
thus
being
called
by
this
holy
calling
and
ordained
untothe
high
priesthood
of
the
holy
order
of
god
to
teach
hiscommandments
unto
the
children
of
men
that
they
also
might
enterinto
his
restalma


this
high
priesthood
being
after
the
order
of
his
son
whichorder
was
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
or
in
other
wordsbeing
without
beginning
of
days
or
end
of
years
being
preparedfrom
eternity
to
all
eternity
according
to
his
foreknowledge
ofall
thingsalma


now
they
were
ordained
after
this
mannerbeing
called
with
aholy
calling
and
ordained
with
a
holy
ordinance
and
taking
uponthem
the
high
priesthood
of
the
holy
order
which
calling
andordinance
and
high
priesthood
is
without
beginning
or
endalma


thus
they
become
high
priests
forever
after
the
order
of
theson
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
who
is
without
beginning
ofdays
or
end
of
years
who
is
full
of
grace
equity
and
truth
and
thus
it
is

amenalma


now
as
I
said
concerning
the
holy
order
or
this
highpriesthood
there
were
many
who
were
ordained
and
became
highpriests
of
god
and
it
was
on
account
of
their
exceeding
faithand
repentance
and
their
righteousness
before
god
they
choosingto
repent
and
work
righteousness
rather
than
to
perishalma


therefore
they
were
called
after
this
holy
order
and
weresanctified
and
their
garments
were
washed
white
through
theblood
of
the
lambalma


now
they
after
being
sanctified
by
the
holy
ghost
havingtheir
garments
made
white
being
pure
and
spotless
before
godcould
not
look
upon
sin
save
it
were
with
abhorrence
and
therewere
many
exceedingly
great
many
who
were
made
pure
and
enteredinto
the
rest
of
the
lord
their
godalma


and
now
my
brethren
I
would
that
ye
should
humbleyourselves
before
god
and
bring
forth
fruit
meet
for
repentancethat
ye
may
also
enter
into
that
restalma


yea
humble
yourselves
even
as
the
people
in
the
days
ofmelchizedek
who
was
also
a
high
priest
after
this
same
orderwhich
I
have
spoken
who
also
took
upon
him
the
high
priesthoodforeveralma


and
it
was
this
same
melchizedek
to
whom
abraham
paid
tithesyea
even
our
father
abraham
paid
tithes
of
onetenth
part
of
allhe
possessedalma


now
these
ordinances
were
given
after
this
manner
thatthereby
the
people
might
look
forward
on
the
son
of
god
it
beinga
type
of
his
order
or
it
being
his
order
and
this
that
theymight
look
forward
to
him
for
a
remission
of
their
sins
thatthey
might
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
lordalma


now
this
melchizedek
was
a
king
over
the
land
of
salem
andhis
people
had
waxed
strong
in
iniquity
and
abomination
yeathey
had
all
gone
astray
they
were
full
of
all
manner
ofwickednessalma


but
melchizedek
having
exercised
mighty
faith
and
receivedthe
office
of
the
high
priesthood
according
to
the
holy
order
ofgod
did
preach
repentance
unto
his
people

and
behold
they
didrepent
and
melchizedek
did
establish
peace
in
the
land
in
hisdays
therefore
he
was
called
the
prince
of
peace
for
he
was
theking
of
salem
and
he
did
reign
under
his
fatheralma


now
there
were
many
before
him
and
also
there
were
manyafterwards
but
none
were
greater
therefore
of
him
they
havemore
particularly
made
mentionalma


now
I
need
not
rehearse
the
matter
what
I
have
said
maysuffice

behold
the
scriptures
are
before
you
if
ye
will
wrestthem
it
shall
be
to
your
own
destructionalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
alma
had
said
these
wordsunto
them
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
unto
them
and
cried
with
amighty
voice
saying
now
is
the
time
to
repent
for
the
day
ofsalvation
draweth
nighalma


yea
and
the
voice
of
the
lord
by
the
mouth
of
angels
dothdeclare
it
unto
all
nations
yea
doth
declare
it
that
they
mayhave
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
yea
and
he
doth
sound
these
gladtidings
among
all
his
people
yea
even
to
them
that
arescattered
abroad
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
wherefore
they
havecome
unto
usalma


and
they
are
made
known
unto
us
in
plain
terms
that
we
mayunderstand
that
we
cannot
err
and
this
because
of
our
beingwanderers
in
a
strange
land
therefore
we
are
thus
highlyfavored
for
we
have
these
glad
tidings
declared
unto
us
in
allparts
of
our
vineyardalma


for
behold
angels
are
declaring
it
unto
many
at
this
time
inour
land
and
this
is
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
the
hearts
ofthe
children
of
men
to
receive
his
word
at
the
time
of
his
comingin
his
gloryalma


and
now
we
only
wait
to
hear
the
joyful
news
declared
unto
usby
the
mouth
of
angels
of
his
coming
for
the
time
cometh
weknow
not
how
soon

would
to
god
that
it
might
be
in
my
day
butlet
it
be
sooner
or
later
in
it
I
will
rejoicealma


and
it
shall
be
made
known
unto
just
and
holy
men
by
themouth
of
angels
at
the
time
of
his
coming
that
the
words
of
ourfathers
may
be
fulfilled
according
to
that
which
they
havespoken
concerning
him
which
was
according
to
the
spirit
ofprophecy
which
was
in
themalma


and
now
my
brethren
I
wish
from
the
inmost
part
of
myheart
yea
with
great
anxiety
even
unto
pain
that
ye
wouldhearken
unto
my
words
and
cast
off
your
sins
and
notprocrastinate
the
day
of
your
repentancealma


but
that
ye
would
humble
yourselves
before
the
lord
and
callon
his
holy
name
and
watch
and
pray
continually
that
ye
may
notbe
tempted
above
that
which
ye
can
bear
and
thus
be
led
by
theholy
spirit
becoming
humble
meek
submissive
patient
full
oflove
and
all
longsufferingalma


having
faith
on
the
lord
having
a
hope
that
ye
shall
receiveeternal
life
having
the
love
of
god
always
in
your
hearts
thatye
may
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
and
enter
into
his
restalma


and
may
the
lord
grant
unto
you
repentance
that
ye
may
notbring
down
his
wrath
upon
you
that
ye
may
not
be
bound
down
bythe
chains
of
hell
that
ye
may
not
suffer
the
second
deathalma


and
alma
spake
many
more
words
unto
the
people
which
are
notwritten
in
this
bookalma
chapter
alma


and
it
came
to
pass
after
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
untothe
people
many
of
them
did
believe
on
his
words
and
began
torepent
and
to
search
the
scripturesalma


but
the
more
part
of
them
were
desirous
that
they
mightdestroy
alma
and
amulek
for
they
were
angry
with
alma
becauseof
the
plainness
of
his
words
unto
zeezrom
and
they
also
saidthat
amulek
had
lied
unto
them
and
had
reviled
against
their
lawand
also
against
their
lawyers
and
judgesalma


and
they
were
also
angry
with
alma
and
amulek
and
becausethey
had
testified
so
plainly
against
their
wickedness
theysought
to
put
them
away
privilyalma


but
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
not
but
they
took
them
andbound
them
with
strong
cords
and
took
them
before
the
chiefjudge
of
the
landalma


and
the
people
went
forth
and
witnessed
againstthemtestifying
that
they
had
reviled
against
the
law
and
theirlawyers
and
judges
of
the
land
and
also
of
all
the
people
thatwere
in
the
land
and
also
testified
that
there
was
but
one
godand
that
he
should
send
his
son
among
the
people
but
he
shouldnot
save
them
and
many
such
things
did
the
people
testifyagainst
alma
and
amulek

now
this
was
done
before
the
chiefjudge
of
the
landalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
zeezrom
was
astonished
at
the
wordswhich
had
been
spoken
and
he
also
knew
concerning
the
blindnessof
the
minds
which
he
had
caused
among
the
people
by
his
lyingwords
and
his
soul
began
to
be
harrowed
up
under
a
consciousnessof
his
own
guilt
yea
he
began
to
be
encircled
about
by
thepains
of
hellalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
began
to
cry
unto
the
peoplesaying
behold
I
am
guilty
and
these
men
are
spotless
beforegod

and
he
began
to
plead
for
them
from
that
time
forth
butthey
reviled
him
saying
art
thou
also
possessed
with
the
deviland
they
spit
upon
him
and
cast
him
out
from
among
them
andalso
all
those
who
believed
in
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
byalma
and

they
cast

out

they
brought
their
wives

together
andwhosoever
believed

had
been
taught
to
believe
in

word
ofgod
they
caused
that
they
should
be
cast

theyalso
brought
forth
their
records
which
contained
the
holyscriptures
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
also
that
they
might
beburned
and
destroyed
by

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
alma
and
amulek
andcarried
them
forth
to
the
place
of
martyrdom
that
they
mightwitness
the
destruction
of

and
when
amulek
saw
the
pains
of

whowere
consuming
in

fire
he
also
was
pained
and
he
said

how

forth
our
hands
and
exercise
the
power
of

but
alma
said
unto
him
the

constraineth
me
that
Imust
not
stretch

behold
the
lord
receiveththem
up

according
to

will
of

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
bodies
of
those
who
hadbeen
cast
into
the
fire
were
consumed
and
also
the
records
whichwere
cast
in
with
them
the
chief

came
andstood
before
alma

amulek
as
they
were

he
smotethem
with

said
unto

many

they

they
began
to
flee

and
it
came
to

that
so
great
was
their

that
theyfell
to

and
did

and
alma

came
forth
out

theywere
not
hurt
for
the
lord

granted
unto
them
poweraccording
to

and
theystraightway
came
forth
out

they
were

now
the

having
heard
a

noise
came
runningtogether
by

when

sawalma

and
fled
from

and
it
came
to

they
departed
and
came
out

they
found

who
had
departed
out

who
hadbeen
cast
out
and
stoned
because
they
believed

and
they
related
unto
them
all
that

happened
unto

and
children
and
also
concerning
themselves
and
of
theirpower
of
deliverancealma


and
also
zeezrom
lay
sick
at
sidom
with
a
burning
feverwhich
was
caused
by
the
great
tribulations
of
his
mind
on
accountof
his
wickedness
for
he
supposed
that
alma
and
amulek
were
nomore
and
he
supposed
that
they
had
been
slain
because
of
hisiniquity

and
this
great
sin
and
his
many
other
sins
didharrow
up
his
mind
until
it
did
become
exceedingly
sore
havingno
deliverance
therefore
he
began
to
be
scorched
with
a
burningheatalma


now
when
he
heard
that
alma
and
amulek
were
in
the
land
ofsidom
his
heart
began
to
take
courage
and
he
sent
a
messageimmediately
unto
them
desiring
them
to
come
unto
himalma


and
it
came
to

that
they
went
immediately
obeying

which
he
had
sent
unto

and
they
went
in
unto

zeezrom
and
they
found
him
upon
his
bed
sick
beingvery
low
with
a
burning
fever
and
his
mind
also
was
exceedinglysore
because
of
his
iniquities
and
when
he
saw
them
he
stretchedforth
his
hand
and
besought
them
that
they
would
heal
himalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
said
unto
him
taking
him
by
thehand
believest
thou
in
the
power
of

unto

and
he
answered
and
said

and
he
said
yea
I
believe

and
then
alma
cried
unto
the
lord
saying
o
lord
our
godhave
mercy
on
this
man
and
heal
him
according
to
his
faith
whichis
in

and
when
alma
had
said
these
words
zeezrom
leaped
upon
hisfeet
and
began
to
walk
and
this
was
done
to
the
greatastonishment
of
all
the
people
and
the
knowledge
of
this
wentforth
throughout

baptized
zeezrom
unto
the

and
he
began
fromthat
time
forth
to
preach
unto
the
peoplealma


and
alma
established
a
church
in

land

teachers
in
the
land
to
baptize
unto
thelord
whosoever
were
desirous
to
be
baptizedalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
many
for
they
did
flockin
from
all
the
region
round
about
sidom
and
were
baptizedalma


but
as
to
the
people
that
were
in
the
land
of
ammonihah
theyyet
remained
a
hardhearted
and
a
stiffnecked
people
and
theyrepented
not
of
their
sins
ascribing
all
the
power
of
alma
andamulek
to
the
devil
for
they
were
of
the
profession
of
nehorand
did
not
believe
in
the
repentance
of
their
sinsalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
and
amulek
amulek
havingforsaken
all
his
gold
and
silver
and
his
precious
things
whichwere
in

the
word
of

beingrejected
by
those
who
were

his
friends

also
by

therefore
after
alma
having
established
the
church
at
sidomseeing
a
great
check
yea
seeing
that
the
people
were
checked
asto
the
pride
of
their
hearts
and
began
to
humble
themselvesbefore
god
and
began
to
assemble
themselves
together
at
theirsanctuaries
to
worship
god
before
the
altar
watching
and
prayingcontinually
that
they
might
be
delivered
from
satan

fromdeath
and
from

now
as
I
said

having
seen
all
these
things
thereforehe
took

and
came
over

was
a
cry
of

heard
throughout

for
behold
the
armies

lamanites
had
come
in
upon

side
into

borders

into

to

army
to

somearound

taken

captive

now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
were
desirous
to
obtainthose
who
had
been
carried
away
captive
into
the
wildernessalma


therefore
he
that

therefore
they
went
unto

anddesired

to
know
whither
the
lord
would
that
they
should
gointo
the
wilderness
in
search
of
their
brethren
who
had
beentaken
captive
by
the
lamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
inquired
of
the
lord
concerningthe
matter

and
alma
returned
and
said
unto
them
behold
thelamanites

cross

the

deliver

and
it
came
to

that
zoram
and
his

crossed
over
theriver
sidon

marched
away
beyond

they

theytook
their

been
driven
out

destroyed

their

but
behold
in
one
day
it
was
left
desolate

thecarcasses
were
mangled
by
dogs

wild
beasts
of

wildernessalma


nevertheless
after
many
days
their
dead
bodies
were
heapedup
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
they
were
covered
with
ashallow
covering

and
now
so
great
was
the
scent
thereof
thatthe
people
did
not
go
in
to
possess
the
land
of
ammonihah
formany
years

and
it
was
called
desolation
of

who
were
slain
and
their

desolatealma


and
the
lamanites
did
not
come
again
to
war
against

until
the
fourteenth
year
of
the
reign
of

thus
for
three
years
did
thepeople
of

have
continual
peace
in
all

and
alma

amulek
went
forth
preaching
repentance
to

in
their
temples

in

also
intheir
synagogues

were
built
after

many
as

hear

words
unto

they
didimpart
the
word
of

without
any
respect

and
thus
did
alma
and
amulek
go
forth
and
also
many
more
whohad
been
chosen
for
the
work
to
preach
the
word

and
there
was
no
inequality
among
them
the
lord
did
pour
outhis
spirit
on
all
the
face
of
the
land
to
prepare
the
minds
ofthe
children
of
men
or
to
prepare
their
hearts
to
receive
theword
which
should
be
taught
among
them
at
the
time
of

that
they
might
not
be
hardened
against
the
word
that
theymight
not
be
unbelieving
and
go
on
to
destruction
but
that
theymight
receive
the
word
with
joy
and
as
a
branch
be
grafted
intothe
true
vine
that
they
might
enter
into

now
those

did
go
forth
among

didpreach
against

the
resurrection

and
many
of
the
people
did
inquire
concerning
the
place
wherethe
son
of
god
should
come
and
they
were
taught
that
he
wouldappear
unto
them
after
his
resurrection
and
this
the
people
didhear
with
great
joy
and
gladnessalma


and
now
after
the
church
had
been
established
throughout
allthe
landhaving
got
the
victory
over
the
devil
and
the
word
ofgod

purity

alma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
as
alma
was
journeying
from
theland
of
gideon
southward
away
to
the
land
of
manti
behold
tohis
astonishment
he
met
with
the
sons
of
mosiah
journeyingtowards
the
land
of
zarahemlaalma


now
these
sons
of
mosiah
were
with
alma
at
the
time
the
angelfirst
appeared
unto
him
therefore
alma
did
rejoice
exceedinglyto
see
his
brethren
and
what
added
more
to
his
joy
they
werestill
his
brethren
in
the
lord
yea
and
they
had
waxed
strong
inthe
knowledge
of
the
truth
for
they
were
men
of
a
soundunderstanding
and
they
had
searched
the
scriptures
diligentlythat
they
might
know
the
word
of
godalma


but
this
is
not
all
they
had
given
themselves
to
much
prayerand
fasting
therefore
they
had
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
thespirit
of
revelation
and
when
they
taught
they
taught
withpower
and
authority
of
godalma


and
they
had
been
teaching
the
word
of
god
for
the
space
offourteen
years
among
the
lamanites
having
had
much
success
inbringing
many
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
yea
by
the
power
oftheir
words
many
were
brought
before
the
altar
of
god
to
call
onhis
name
and
confess
their
sins
before
himalma


now
these
are
the
circumstances
which
attended
them
in
theirjourneyings
for
they
had
many
afflictions
they
did
suffer
muchboth
in
body
and
in
mind
such
as
hunger
thirst
and
fatigue
andalso
much
labor
in
the
spiritalma


now
these
were
their
journeyings
having
taken
leave
of
theirfather
mosiah
in
the
first
year
of
the
judges
having
refusedthe
kingdom
which
their
father
was
desirous
to
confer
upon
themand
also
this
was
the
minds
of
the
peoplealma


nevertheless
they
departed
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
andtook
their
swords
and
their
spears
and
their
bows
and
theirarrows
and
their
slings
and
this
they
did
that
they
mightprovide
food
for
themselves
while
in
the
wildernessalma


and
thus
they
departed
into
the
wilderness
with
their
numberswhich
they
had
selected
to
go
up
to
the
land
of
nephi
to
preachthe
word
of
god
unto
the
lamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
journeyed
many
days
in
thewilderness
and
they
fasted
much
and
prayed
much
that
the
lordwould
grant
unto
them
a
portion
of
his
spirit
to
go
with
themand
abide
with
them
that
they
might
be
an
instrument
in
thehands
of
god
to
bring
if
it
were
possible
their
brethren
thelamanites
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
to
the
knowledge
of
thebaseness
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
which
were
notcorrectalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
did
visit
them
with
hisspirit
and
said
unto
them
be
comforted

and
they
werecomfortedalma


and
the
lord
said
unto
them
also
go
forth
among
thelamanites
thy
brethren
and
establish
my
word
yet
ye
shall
bepatient
in
longsuffering
and
afflictions
that
ye
may
show
forthgood
examples
unto
them
in
me
and
I
will
make
an
instrument
ofthee
in
my
hands
unto
the
salvation
of
many
soulsalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
hearts
of
the
sons
of
mosiahand
also
those
who
were
with
them
took
courage
to
go
forth
untothe
lamanites
to
declare
unto
them
the
word
of
godalma


and
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
arrived
in
the
borders
ofthe
land
of
the
lamanites
that
they
separated
themselves
anddeparted
one
from
another
trusting
in
the
lord
that
they
shouldmeet
again
at
the
close
of
their
harvest
for
they
supposed
thatgreat
was
the
work
which
they
had
undertakenalma


and
assuredly
it
was
great
for
they
had
undertaken
to
preachthe
word
of
god
to
a
wild
and
a
hardened
and
a
ferocious
peoplea
people
who
delighted
in
murdering
the
nephites
and
robbing
andplundering
them
and
their
hearts
were
set
upon
riches
or
upongold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
yet
they
sought
to
obtainthese
things
by
murdering
and
plundering
that
they
might
notlabor
for
them
with
their
own
handsalma


thus
they
were
a
very
indolent
people
many
of
whom
didworship
idols
and
the
curse
of
god
had
fallen
upon
them
becauseof
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
notwithstanding
the
promisesof
the
lord
were
extended
unto
them
on
the
conditions
ofrepentancealma


therefore
this
was
the
cause
for
which
the
sons
of
mosiahhad
undertaken
the
work
that
perhaps
they
might
bring
them
untorepentance
that
perhaps
they
might
bring
them
to
know
of
theplan
of
redemptionalma


therefore
they
separated
themselves
one
from
another
andwent
forth
among
them
every
man
alone
according
to
the
word
andpower
of
god
which
was
given
unto
himalma


now
ammon
being
the
chief
among
them
or
rather
he
didadminister
unto
them
and
he
departed
from
them
after
havingblessed
them
according
to
their
several
stations
having
impartedthe
word
of
god
unto
them
or
administered
unto
them
before
hisdeparture
and
thus
they
took
their
several
journeys
throughoutthe
landalma


and
ammon
went
to
the
land
of
Ishmael
the
land
being
calledafter
the
sons
of
Ishmael
who
also
became
lamanitesalma


and
as
ammon
entered
the
land
of
Ishmael
the
lamanites
tookhim
and
bound
him
as
was
their
custom
to
bind
all
the
nephiteswho
fell
into
their
hands
and
carry
them
before
the
king
andthus
it
was
left
to
the
pleasure
of
the
king
to
slay
them
or
toretain
them
in
captivity
or
to
cast
them
into
prison
or
to
castthem
out
of
his
land
according
to
his
will
and
pleasurealma


and
thus
ammon
was
carried
before
the
king
who
was
over
theland
of
Ishmael
and
his
name
was
lamoni
and
he
was
a
descendantof
Ishmaelalma


and
the
king
inquired
of
ammon
if
it
were
his
desire
to
dwellin
the
land
among
the
lamanites
or
among
his
peoplealma


and
ammon
said
unto
him
yea
I
desire
to
dwell
among
thispeople
for
a
time
yea
and
perhaps
until
the
day
I
diealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
lamoni
was
much
pleased
withammon
and
caused
that
his
bands
should
be
loosed
and
he
wouldthat
ammon
should
take
one
of
his
daughters
to
wifealma


but
ammon
said
unto
him
nay
but
I
will
be
thy
servant
therefore
ammon
became
a
servant
to
king
lamoni

and
it
came
topass
that
he
was
set
among
other
servants
to
watch
the
flocks
oflamoni
according
to
the
custom
of
the
lamanitesalma


and
after
he
had
been
in
the
service
of
the
king
three
daysas
he
was
with
the
lamanitish
servants
going
forth
with
theirflocks
to
the
place
of
water
which
was
called
the
water
ofsebus
and
all
the
lamanites
drive
their
flocks
hither
that
theymay
have
wateralma


therefore
as
ammon
and
the
servants
of
the
king
were
drivingforth
their
flocks
to
this
place
of
water
behold
a
certainnumber
of
the
lamanites
who
had
been
with
their
flocks
to
waterstood
and
scattered
the
flocks
of
ammon
and
the
servants
of
theking
and
they
scattered
them
insomuch
that
they
fled
many
waysalma


now
the
servants
of
the
king
began
to
murmur
saying
now
theking
will
slay
us
as
he
has
our
brethren
because
their
flockswere
scattered
by
the
wickedness
of
these
men

and
they
began
toweep
exceedingly
saying
behold
our
flocks
are
scatteredalreadyalma


now
they
wept
because
of
the
fear
of
being
slain

now
whenammon
saw
this
his
heart
was
swollen
within
him
with
joy
forsaid
he
I
will
show
forth
my
power
unto
these
myfellowservants
or
the
power
which
is
in
me
in
restoring
theseflocks
unto
the
king
that
I
may
win
the
hearts
of
these
myfellowservants
that
I
may
lead
them
to
believe
in
my
wordsalma


and
now
these
were
the
thoughts
of
ammon
when
he
saw
theafflictions
of
those
whom
he
termed
to
be
his
brethrenalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
flattered
them
by
his
wordssaying
my
brethren
be
of
good
cheer
and
let
us
go
in
search
ofthe
flocks
and
we
will
gather
them
together
and
bring
them
backunto
the
place
of
water
and
thus
we
will
preserve
the
flocksunto
the
king
and
he
will
not
slay
usalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
in
search
of
the
flocksand
they
did
follow
ammon
and
they
rushed
forth
with
muchswiftness
and
did
head
the
flocks
of
the
king
and
did
gatherthem
together
again
to
the
place
of
wateralma


and
those
men
again
stood
to
scatter
their
flocks
but
ammonsaid
unto
his
brethren
encircle
the
flocks
round
about
that
theyflee
not
and
I
go
and
contend
with
these
men
who
do
scatter
ourflocksalma


therefore
they
did
as
ammon
commanded
them
and
he
wentforth
and
stood
to
contend
with
those
who
stood
by
the
waters
ofsebus
and
they
were
in
number
not
a
fewalma


therefore
they
did
not
fear
ammon
for
they
supposed
that
oneof
their
men
could
slay
him
according
to
their
pleasure
for
theyknew
not
that
the
lord
had
promised
mosiah
that
he
would
deliverhis
sons
out
of
their
hands
neither
did
they
know
anythingconcerning
the
lord
therefore
they
delighted
in
the
destructionof
their
brethren
and
for
this
cause
they
stood
to
scatter
theflocks
of
the
kingalma


but
ammon
stood
forth
and
began
to
cast
stones
at
them
withhis
sling
yea
with
mighty
power
he
did
sling
stones
amongstthem
and
thus
he
slew
a
certain
number
of
them
insomuch
thatthey
began
to
be
astonished
at
his
power
nevertheless
they
wereangry
because
of
the
slain
of
their
brethren
and
they
weredetermined
that
he
should
fall
therefore
seeing
that
they
couldnot
hit
him
with
their
stones
they
came
forth
with
clubs
to
slayhimalma


but
behold
every
man
that
lifted
his
club
to
smite
ammon
hesmote
off
their
arms
with
his
sword
for
he
did
withstand
theirblows
by
smiting
their
arms
with
the
edge
of
his
sword
insomuchthat
they
began
to
be
astonished
and
began
to
flee
before
himyea
and
they
were
not
few
in
number
and
he
caused
them
to
fleeby
the
strength
of
his
armalma


now
six
of
them
had
fallen
by
the
sling
but
he
slew
nonesave
it
were
their
leader
with
his
sword
and
he
smote
off
asmany
of
their
arms
as
were
lifted
against
him
and
they
were
nota
fewalma


and
when
he
had
driven
them
afar
off
he
returned
and
theywatered
their
flocks
and
returned
them
to
the
pasture
of
theking
and
then
went
in
unto
the
king
bearing
the
arms
which
hadbeen
smitten
off
by
the
sword
of
ammon
of
those
who
sought
toslay
him
and
they
were
carried
in
unto
the
king
for
a
testimonyof
the
things
which
they
had
donealma
chapter
alma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
lamoni
caused
that
his
servantsshould
stand
forth
and
testify
to
all
the
things
which
they
hadseen
concerning
the
matteralma


and
when
they
had
all
testified
to
the
things
which
they
hadseen
and
he
had
learned
of
the
faithfulness
of
ammon
inpreserving
his
flocks
and
also
of
his
great
power
in
contendingagainst
those
who
sought
to
slay
him
he
was
astonishedexceedingly
and
said
surely
this
is
more
than
a
man

beholdis
not
this
the
great
spirit
who
doth
send
such
great
punishmentsupon
this
people
because
of
their
murdersalma


and
they
answered
the
king
and
said
whether
he
be
the
greatspirit
or
a
man
we
know
not
but
this
much
we
do
know
that
hecannot
be
slain
by
the
enemies
of
the
king
neither
can
theyscatter
the
kings
flocks
when
he
is
with
us
because
of
hisexpertness
and
great
strength
therefore
we
know
that
he
is
afriend
to
the
king

and
now
o
king
we
do
not
believe
that
aman
has
such
great
power
for
we
know
he
cannot
be
slainalma


and
now
when
the
king
heard
these
words
he
said
unto
themnow
I
know
that
it
is
the
great
spirit
and
he
has
come
down
atthis
time
to
preserve
your
lives
that
I
might
not
slay
you
as
Idid
your
brethren

now
this
is
the
great
spirit
of
whom
ourfathers
have
spokenalma


now
this
was
the
tradition
of
lamoni
which
he
had
receivedfrom
his
father
that
there
was
a
great
spirit

notwithstandingthey
believed
in
a
great
spirit
they
supposed
that
whatsoeverthey
did
was
right
nevertheless
lamoni
began
to
fearexceedingly
with
fear
lest
he
had
done
wrong
in
slaying
hisservantsalma


for
he
had
slain
many
of
them
because
their
brethren
hadscattered
their
flocks
at
the
place
of
water
and
thus
becausethey
had
had
their
flocks
scattered
they
were
slainalma


now
it
was
the
practice
of
these
lamanites
to
stand
by
thewaters
of
sebus
to
scatter
the
flocks
of
the
people
that
therebythey
might
drive
away
many
that
were
scattered
unto
their
ownland
it
being
a
practice
of
plunder
among
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
lamoni
inquired
of
his
servantssaying
where
is
this
man
that
has
such
great
poweralma


and
they
said
unto
him
behold
he
is
feeding
thy
horses

nowthe
king
had
commanded
his
servants
previous
to
the
time
of
thewatering
of
their
flocks
that
they
should
prepare
his
horses
andchariots
and
conduct
him
forth
to
the
land
of
nephi
for
therehad
been
a
great
feast
appointed
at
the
land
of
nephi
by
thefather
of
lamoni
who
was
king
over
all
the
landalma


now
when
king
lamoni
heard
that
ammon
was
preparing
hishorses
and
his
chariots
he
was
more
astonished
because
of
thefaithfulness
of
ammon
saying
surely
there
has
not
been
anyservant
among
all
my
servants
that
has
been
so
faithful
as
thisman
for
even
he
doth
remember
all
my
commandments
to
executethemalma


now
I
surely
know
that
this
is
the
great
spirit
and
I
woulddesire
him
that
he
come
in
unto
me
but
I
durst
notalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
ammon
had
made
ready
the
horsesand
the
chariots
for
the
king
and
his
servants
he
went
in
untothe
king
and
he
saw
that
the
countenance
of
the
king
waschanged
therefore
he
was
about
to
return
out
of
his
presencealma


and
one
of
the
kings
servants
said
unto
him
rabbanah
whichis
being
interpreted
powerful
or
great
king
considering
theirkings
to
be
powerful
and
thus
he
said
unto
him
rabbanah
theking
desireth
thee
to
stayalma


therefore
ammon
turned
himself
unto
the
king
and
said
untohim
what
wilt
thou
that
I
should
do
for
thee
o
king

and
theking
answered
him
not
for
the
space
of
an
hour
according
totheir
time
for
he
knew
not
what
he
should
say
unto
himalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
said
unto
him
again
whatdesirest
thou
of
me

but
the
king
answered
him
notalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
being
filled
with
the
spiritof
god
therefore
he
perceived
the
thoughts
of
the
king

and
hesaid
unto
him
Is
it
because
thou
hast
heard
that
I
defended
thyservants
and
thy
flocks
and
slew
seven
of
their
brethren
withthe
sling
and
with
the
sword
and
smote
off
the
arms
of
othersin
order
to
defend
thy
flocks
and
thy
servants
behold
is
itthis
that
causeth
thy
marvelingsalma


I
say
unto
you
what
is
it
that
thy
marvelings
are
so
greatbehold
I
am
a
man
and
am
thy
servant
therefore
whatsoeverthou
desirest
which
is
right
that
will
I
doalma


now
when
the
king
had
heard
these
words
he
marveled
againfor
he
beheld
that
ammon
could
discern

the
king
said
how
knowest

mayest
speak
boldly
and
tell

concerning

now
ammon

thus

ammon
said
unto
him
I
am
a
man

man

beginning
wascreated
after
the
image
of

I
am
called

now
when
ammon
had
said
these
words
he
began
at
the
creationof
the
world
and
also
the
creation
of
adam

told
him
all
thethings
concerning
the
fall
of

rehearsed

laid
beforehim
the

hadbeen
spoken
by
the
prophets
even
down
to
the
time
that
theirfather
lehi
left
jerusalemalma


and
he
also
rehearsed
unto
them
for
it
was
unto
the
king
andto
his
servants
all
the
journeyings
of
their
fathers
in
thewilderness
and
all
their
sufferings
with
hunger
and
thirst
andtheir
travail

so
forthalma


and
he
also
rehearsed
unto
them
concerning
the
rebellions
oflaman
and
lemuel
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
yea
all
theirrebellions
did
he
relate
unto
them

he
expounded
unto
themall
the
records
and
scriptures
from
the
time
that
lehi
leftjerusalem
down
to
the
present
timealma


but
this
is
not
all
for
he
expounded
unto
them
the
plan
ofredemption
which
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
worldand
he
also
made
known
unto
them
concerning
the
coming
of
christand
all
the
works
of
the
lord
did
he
make
known
unto
themalma


and
it
came
to

that
after
he
had
said
all
these
thingsand
expounded
them
to
the
king
that
the
king
believed
all
hiswordsalma


and
he
began
to
cry
unto

lord

o

to
thy
abundant
mercy

and
now
when
he
had
said
this
he
fell
unto

earth
as
ifhe

and
it
came
to
pass
that
his
servants
took
him
and
carriedhim
in
unto
his
wife
and
laid
him
upon
a
bed
and
he
lay
as
ifhe
were
dead
for
the
space
of
two
days
and
two
nights
and
hiswife
and
his
sons
and
his
daughters
mourned
over
him
after
themanner
of
the
lamanites
greatly
lamenting
his
lossalma
chapter
alma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
two
days
and
two
nights
theywere
about
to
take
his
body
and
lay
it
in
a
sepulchre
which
theyhad
made
for
the
purpose
of
burying
their
deadalma


now
the
queen
having
heard
of
the
fame
of
ammon
therefore
shesent
and
desired
that
he
should
come
in
unto
heralma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
did
as
he
was
commanded
andwent
in
unto
the
queen
and
desired
to
know
what
she
would
thathe
should
doalma


and
she
said
unto
him
the
servants
of
my
husband
have
made
itknown
unto
me
that
thou
art
a
prophet
of
a
holy
god
and
thatthou
hast
power
to
do
many
mighty
works
in
his
namealma


therefore
if
this
is
the
case
I
would
that
ye
should
go
inand
see
my
husband
for
he
has
been
laid
upon
his
bed
for
thespace
of
two
days
and
two
nights
and
some
say
that
he
is
notdead
but
others
say
that
he
is
dead
and
that
he
stinketh
andthat
he
ought
to
be
placed
in
the
sepulchre
but
as
for
myselfto
me
he
doth
not
stinkalma


now
this
was
what
ammon
desired
for
he
knew
that
king
lamoniwas
under
the
power
of
god
he
knew
that
the
dark
veil
ofunbelief
was
being
cast
away
from
his
mind
and
the
light
whichdid
light
up
his
mind
which
was
the
light
of
the
glory
of
godwhich
was
a
marvelous
light
of
his
goodnessyea
this
light
hadinfused
such
joy
into
his
soul
the
cloud
of
darkness
having
beendispelled
and
that
the
light
of
everlasting
life
was
lit
up
inhis
soul
yea
he
knew
that
this
had
overcome
his
natural
frameand
he
was
carried
away
in
godalma


therefore
what
the
queen
desired
of
him
was
his
only
desire
therefore
he
went
in
to
see
the
king
according
as
the
queen
haddesired
him
and
he
saw
the
king
and
he
knew
that
he
was
notdeadalma


and
he
said
unto
the
queen
he
is
not
dead
but
he
sleepeth
ingod
and
on
the
morrow
he
shall
rise
again
therefore
bury
himnotalma


and
ammon
said
unto
her
believest
thou
this

and
she
saidunto
him
I
have
had
no
witness
save
thy
word
and
the
word
ofour
servants
nevertheless
I
believe
that
it
shall
be
accordingas
thou
hast
saidalma


and
ammon
said
unto
her
blessed
art
thou
because
of
thyexceeding
faith
I
say
unto
thee
woman
there
has
not
been
suchgreat
faith
among
all
the
people
of
the
nephitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
she
watched
over
the
bed
of
herhusband
from
that
time
even
until
that
time
on
the
morrow
whichammon
had
appointed
that
he
should
risealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
arose
according
to
the
words
ofammon
and
as
he
arose
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
unto
thewoman
and
said
blessed
be
the
name
of
god
and
blessed
artthoualma


for
as
sure
as
thou
livest
behold
I
have
seen
my
redeemerand
he
shall
come
forth
and
be
born
of
a
woman
and
he
shallredeem
all
mankind
who
believe
on
his
name

now
when
he
hadsaid
these
words
his
heart
was
swollen
within
him
and
he
sunkagain
with
joy
and
the
queen
also
sunk
down
being
overpoweredby
the
spiritalma


now
ammon
seeing
the
spirit
of
the
lord
poured
out
accordingto
his
prayers
upon
the
lamanites
his
brethren
who
had
been
thecause
of
so
much
mourning
among
the
nephites
or
among
all
thepeople
of
god
because
of
their
iniquities
and
their
traditionshe
fell
upon
his
knees
and
began
to
pour
out
his
soul
in
prayerand
thanksgiving
to
god
for
what
he
had
done
for
his
brethrenand
he
was
also
overpowered
with
joy
and
thus
they
all
three
hadsunk
to
the
earthalma


now
when
the
servants
of
the
king
had
seen
that
they
hadfallen
they
also
began
to
cry
unto
god
for
the
fear
of
the
lordhad
come
upon
them
also
for
it
was
they
who
had
stood
before
theking
and
testified
unto
him
concerning
the
great
power
of
ammonalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
call
on
the
name
of
thelord
in
their
might
even
until
they
had
all
fallen
to
theearth
save
it
were
one
of
the
lamanitish
women
whose
name
wasabish
she
having
been
converted
unto
the
lord
for
many
years
onaccount
of
a
remarkable
vision
of
her
fatheralma


thus
having
been
converted
to
the
lord
and
never
havingmade
it
known
therefore
when
she
saw
that
all
the
servants
oflamoni
had
fallen
to
the
earth
and
also
her
mistress
the
queenand
the
king
and
ammon
lay
prostrate
upon
the
earth
she
knewthat
it
was
the
power
of
god
and
supposing
that
thisopportunity
by
making
known
unto
the
people
what
had
happenedamong
them
that
by
beholding
this
scene
it
would
cause
them
tobelieve
in
the
power
of
god
therefore
she
ran
forth
from
houseto
house
making
it
known
unto
the
peoplealma


and
they
began
to
assemble
themselves
together
unto
the
houseof
the
king

and
there
came
a
multitude
and
to
theirastonishment
they
beheld
the
king
and
the
queen
and
theirservants
prostrate
upon
the
earth
and
they
all
lay
there
asthough
they
were
dead
and
they
also
saw
ammon
and
behold
hewas
a
nephitealma


and
now
the
people
began
to
murmur
among
themselves
somesaying
that
it
was
a
great
evil
that
had
come
upon
them
or
uponthe
king
and
his
house
because
he
had
suffered
that
the
nephiteshould
remain
in
the
landalma


but
others
rebuked
them
saying
the
king
hath
brought
thisevil
upon
his
house
because
he
slew
his
servants
who
had
hadtheir
flocks
scattered
at
the
waters
of
sebusalma


and
they
were
also
rebuked
by
those
men
who
had
stood
at
thewaters
of
sebus
and
scattered
the
flocks
which
belonged
to
theking
for
they
were
angry
with
ammon
because
of
the
number
whichhe
had
slain
of
their
brethren
at
the
waters
of
sebus
whiledefending
the
flocks
of
the
kingalma


now
one
of
them
whose
brother
had
been
slain
with
the
swordof
ammon
being
exceedingly
angry
with
ammon
drew
his
sword
andwent
forth
that
he
might
let
it
fall
upon
ammon
to
slay
him
andas
he
lifted
the
sword
to
smite
him
behold
he
fell
deadalma


now
we
see
that
ammon
could
not
be
slain
for
the
lord
hadsaid
unto
mosiah
his
father
I
will
spare
him
and
it
shall
beunto
him
according
to
thy
faiththerefore
mosiah
trusted
himunto
the
lordalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
multitude
beheld
that
theman
had
fallen
dead
who
lifted
the
sword
to
slay
ammon
fearcame
upon
them
all
and
they
durst
not
put
forth
their
hands
totouch
him
or
any
of
those
who
had
fallen
and
they
began
tomarvel
again
among
themselves
what
could
be
the
cause
of
thisgreat
power
or
what
all
these
things
could
meanalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
among
them
who
saidthat
ammon
was
the
great
spirit
and
others
said
he
was
sent
bythe
great
spiritalma


but
others
rebuked
them
all
saying
that
he
was
a
monsterwho
had
been
sent
from
the
nephites
to
torment
themalma


and
there
were
some
who
said
that
ammon
was
sent
by
the
greatspirit
to
afflict
them
because
of
their
iniquities
and
that
itwas
the
great
spirit
that
had
always
attended
the
nephites
whohad
ever
delivered
them
out
of
their
hands
and
they
said
that
itwas
this
great
spirit
who
had
destroyed
so
many
of
theirbrethren
the
lamanitesalma


and
thus
the
contention
began
to
be
exceedingly
sharp
amongthem

and
while
they
were
thus
contending
the
woman
servant
whohad
caused
the
multitude
to
be
gathered
together
came
and
whenshe
saw
the
contention
which
was
among
the
multitude
she
wasexceedingly
sorrowful
even
unto
tearsalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
she
went
and
took
the
queen
by
thehand
that
perhaps
she
might
raise
her
from
the
ground
and
assoon
as
she
touched
her
hand
she
arose
and
stood
upon
her
feetand
cried
with
a
loud
voice
saying
o
blessed
jesus
who
hassaved
me
from
an
awful
hell

o
blessed
god
have
mercy
on
thispeoplealma


and
when
she
had
said
this
she
clasped
her
hands
beingfilled
with
joy
speaking
many
words
which
were
not
understoodand
when
she
had
done
this
she
took
the
king
lamoni
by
thehand
and
behold
he
arose
and
stood
upon
his
feetalma


and
he
immediately
seeing
the
contention
among
his
peoplewent
forth
and
began
to
rebuke
them
and
to
teach
them
the
wordswhich
he
had
heard
from
the
mouth
of
ammon
and
as
many
as
heardhis
words
believed
and
were
converted
unto
the
lordalma


but
there
were
many
among
them
who
would
not
hear
his
wordstherefore
they
went
their
wayalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
ammon
arose
he
alsoadministered
unto
them
and
also
did
all
the
servants
of
lamoniand
they
did
all
declare
unto
the
people
the
selfsame
thingthattheir
hearts
had
been
changed
that
they
had
no
more
desire
to
doevilalma


and
behold
many
did
declare
unto
the
people
that
they
hadseen
angels
and
had
conversed
with
them
and
thus
they
had
toldthem
things
of
god
and
of
his
righteousnessalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
that
did
believe
intheir
words
and
as
many
as
did
believe
were
baptized
and
theybecame
a
righteous
people
and
they
did
establish
a
church
amongthemalma


and
thus
the
work
of
the
lord
did
commence
among
thelamanites
thus
the
lord
did
begin
to
pour
out
his
spirit
uponthem
and
we
see
that
his
arm
is
extended
to
all
people
who
willrepent
and
believe

chapter
alma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
established
a
church
inthat
land
that
king
lamoni
desired
that
ammon
should
go
with
himto
the
land
of
nephi
that
he
might
show
him
unto
his
fatheralma


and
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
to
ammon
saying
thou
shalt
notgo
up
to
the
land
of

the
king

muloki
and

now
it
came
to

when

saidunto

said

out
of
prisonalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
ammon
and
lamoni
were
journeyingthither
they
met
the
father
of
lamoni
who
was
king
over
all
thelandalma


and
behold
the
father
of
lamoni
said
unto
him
why
did
ye
notcome
to
the
feast
on
that
great
day
when
I
made
a
feast
unto
mysons
and
unto
my
peoplealma


and
he
also
said
whither
art
thou
going
with
this
nephitewho
is
one
of
the
children
of
a
liaralma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
lamoni
rehearsed
unto
him
whither
hewas
going
for
he
feared
to
offend
himalma


and
he
also
told
him
all
the
cause
of
his
tarrying
in
his
ownkingdom
that
he
did
not
go
unto
his
father
to
the
feast
which
hehad
preparedalma


and
now
when
lamoni
had
rehearsed
unto
him
all
these
thingsbehold
to
his
astonishment
his
father
was
angry
with
him
andsaid
lamoni
thou
art
going
to
deliver
these
nephites
who
aresons
of
a
liar

behold
he
robbed
our
fathers
and
now
hischildren
are
also
come
amongst
us
that
they
may
by
their
cunningand
their
lyings
deceive
us
that
they
again
may
rob
us
of
ourpropertyalma


now
the
father
of
lamoni
commanded
him
that
he
should
slayammon
with
the
sword

and
he
also
commanded
him
that
he
shouldnot
go
to
the
land
of
middoni
but
that
he
should
return
with
himto
the
land
of
Ishmaelalma


but
lamoni
said
unto
him
I
will
not
slay
ammon
neither
willI
return
to
the
land
of
Ishmael
but
I
go
to
the
land
of
middonithat
I
may
release
the
brethren
of
ammon
for
I
know
that
theyare
just
men
and
holy
prophets
of
the
true
godalma


now
when
his
father
had
heard
these
words
he
was
angry
withhim
and
he
drew
his
sword
that
he
might
smite
him
to
the
earthalma


but
ammon
stood
forth
and
said
unto
him
behold
thou
shaltnot
slay
thy
son
nevertheless
it
were
better
that
he
shouldfall
than
thee
for
behold
he
has
repented
of
his
sins
but
ifthou
shouldst
fall
at
this
time
in
thine
anger
thy
soul
couldnot
be
savedalma


and
again
it
is
expedient
that
thou
shouldst
forbear
for
ifthou
shouldst
slay
thy
son
he
being
an
innocent
man
his
bloodwould
cry
from
the
ground
to
the
lord
his
god
for
vengeance
tocome
upon
thee
and
perhaps
thou
wouldst
lose
thy
soulalma


now
when
ammon
had
said
these
words
unto
him
he
answeredhim
saying
I
know
that
if
I
should
slay
my
son
that
I
shouldshed
innocent
blood
for
it
is
thou
that
hast
sought
to
destroyhimalma


and
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
to
slay
ammon

but
ammonwithstood
his
blows
and
also
smote
his
arm
that
he
could
not
useitalma


now
when
the
king
saw
that
ammon
could
slay
him
he
began
toplead
with
ammon
that
he
would
spare
his
lifealma


but
ammon
raised
his
sword
and
said
unto
him
behold
I
willsmite
thee
except
thou
wilt
grant
unto
me
that
my
brethren
may
becast
out
of
prisonalma


now
the
king
fearing
he
should
lose
his
life
said
If
thouwilt
spare
me
I
will
grant
unto
thee
whatsoever
thou
wilt
askeven
to
half
of
the
kingdomalma


now
when
ammon
saw
that
he
had
wrought
upon
the
old
kingaccording
to
his
desire
he
said
unto
him
If
thou
wilt
grantthat
my
brethren
may
be
cast
out
of
prison
and
also
that
lamonimay
retain
his
kingdom
and
that
ye
be
not
displeased
with
himbut
grant
that
he
may
do
according
to
his
own
desires
inwhatsoever
thing
he
thinketh
then
will
I
spare
thee
otherwise
Iwill
smite
thee
to
the
earthalma


now
when
ammon
had
said
these
words
the
king
began
torejoice
because
of
his
lifealma


and
when
he
saw
that
ammon
had
no
desire
to
destroy
him
andwhen
he
also
saw
the
great
love
he
had
for
his
son
lamoni
he
wasastonished
exceedingly
and
said
because
this
is
all
that
thouhast
desired
that
I
would
release
thy
brethren
and
suffer
thatmy
son
lamoni
should
retain
his
kingdom
behold
I
will
grantunto
you
that
my
son
may
retain
his
kingdom
from
this
time
andforever
and
I
will
govern
him
no
morealma


and
I
will
also
grant
unto
thee
that
thy
brethren
may
be
castout
of
prison
and
thou
and
thy
brethren
may
come
unto
me
in
mykingdom
for
I
shall
greatly
desire
to
see
thee

for
the
kingwas
greatly
astonished
at
the
words
which
he
had
spoken
and
alsoat
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
his
son
lamoni
thereforehe
was
desirous
to
learn
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
ammon
and
lamoni
proceeded
on
theirjourney
towards
the
land
of
middoni

and
lamoni
found
favor
inthe
eyes
of
the
king
of
the
land
therefore
the
brethren
of
ammonwere
brought
forth
out
of
prisonalma


and
when
ammon
did
meet
them
he
was
exceedingly
sorrowfulfor
behold
they
were
naked
and
their
skins
were
worn
exceedinglybecause
of
being
bound
with
strong
cords

and
they
also
hadsuffered
hunger
thirst
and
all
kinds
of
afflictionsnevertheless
they
were
patient
in
all
their
sufferingsalma


and
as
it
happened
it
was
their
lot
to
have
fallen
into
thehands
of
a
more
hardened
and
a
more
stiffnecked
people
thereforethey
would
not
hearken
unto
their
words

they
had
cast
themout

had
smitten
them

had
driven
them
from
house
tohouse

from
place
to
place

until
they
had
arrived
inthe
land

there
they
were
taken
and
cast

bound

kept
in

now
when
ammon
and
his
brethren
separated
themselves
in
theborders
of
the
land
of
the
lamanites
behold
aaron
took
hisjourney
towards
the
land
which
was
called
by
the
lamanitesjerusalem
calling
it
after
the
land
of
their
fathers
nativityand
it
was
away
joining
the
borders
of

now
the
lamanites
and
the
amalekites
and
the
people
of
amulonhad
built
a
great
city
which
was
called
jerusalemalma


now
the
lamanites
of
themselves
were
sufficiently
hardenedbut
the
amalekites
and
the
amulonites
were
still
hardertherefore
they
did
cause
the
lamanites
that
they
should
hardentheir
hearts
that
they
should
wax
strong
in
wickedness
and
theirabominationsalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
aaron
came
to
the
city
of
jerusalemand
first
began
to
preach
to
the
amalekites

and
he
began
topreach
to
them
in
their
synagogues
for
they
had
built
synagoguesafter
the
order
of
the
nehors
for
many
of
the
amalekites
and
theamulonites
were
after
the
order
of
the
nehorsalma


therefore
as
aaron
entered
into
one
of
their
synagogues
topreach
unto
the
people
and
as
he
was
speaking
unto
them
beholdthere
arose
an
amalekite
and
began
to
contend
with
him
sayingwhat
is
that
thou
hast
testified

hast
thou
seen
an
angel

whydo
not

andwe
do
assemble
ourselves
together
to
worship

we
do
believethat

will

now
aaron
said
unto
him
believest
thou
that
the
son
of
godshall
come
to
redeem
mankind
from
their
sinsalma


and
the
man
said
unto

we
do
not

thou
knowestany
such
thing

we
do
not
believe
in
these
foolish
traditions
we
do
not
believe
that
thou
knowest

dowe
believe

thy

and
also
that
our
fathers
did
knowconcerning
the
things
which
they
spake
of
that
which
is
to
comealma


now
aaron
began
to
open
the
scriptures
unto
them
concerningthe
coming
of
christ
and
also
concerning
the
resurrection
of
thedead
and
that
there
could
be
no
redemption
for
mankind
save
itwere
through
the
death
and
sufferings
of
christ
and
theatonement
of
his
bloodalma


and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
began
to
expound
these
things
untothem
they
were
angry
with
him
and
began
to
mock
him
and
theywould
not
hear
the
words
which
he
spakealma


therefore
when
he
saw
that
they
would
not
hear
his
words
hedeparted
out
of
their
synagogue
and
came
over
to
a
village
whichwas
called
anianti
and
there
he
found
muloki
preaching
the
wordunto
them
and
also
ammah
and
his
brethren

they
contendedwith
many
about
the
wordalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
saw
that
the
people
wouldharden
their
hearts
therefore
they
departed
and
came
over
intothe
land
of
middoni

and
they
did
preach
the
word
unto
many
andfew
believed
on
the
words
which
they
taughtalma


nevertheless
aaron
and
a
certain
number
of
his
brethren
weretaken
and
cast
into
prison

the
remainder
of
them
fled
out
ofthe
land

unto
the
regions
round
aboutalma


and
those
who
were
cast
into

suffered
many
things
andthey
were
delivered
by
the
hand
of
lamoni
and
ammon
and
theywere
fed
and

and
they
went
forth
again
to
declare
the
word

thus
theywere
delivered
for
the
first
time
out
of

thus
theyhad
sufferedalma


and
they
went
forth

synagogue

and
it
came
to

that
the

began
to
bless

that
they
brought
many
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truthyea
they
did
convince
many
of
their
sins

of
the
traditionsof

were
not
correctalma


and
it
came
to

that
ammon

returned
from

the
land
of
Ishmael

land

and
king
lamoni
would
not
suffer
that
ammon
should
serve

his
servantalma


but
he
caused
that
there
should
be
synagogues
built
in
theland
of
Ishmael
and
he
caused
that
his
people
or
the
people
whowere

should
assemble
themselves
togetheralma


and
he
did
rejoice
over
them
and
he
did
teach

manythings

and
he
did
also
declare
unto

that
they
were
a
free

declared

itcame
to

that
he
did
teach

he
did
exhort

now
as
ammon
was
thus
teaching
the
people
of

we
will
return
to
the
account
of
aaron
and
hisbrethren
for
after
he
departed
from

he
wasled
by

spirit
to

kingspalace
with

bowed
himself
before

I
will
not
suffer
that
ye
shall

I
will
insist
that
ye
shall
administer

forI
have
been
somewhat
troubled
in
mind
because
of
the
generosityand
the
greatness
of
the
words
of
thy
brother
ammon

I
desireto
know
the
cause
why
he
has
not
come
up
out
of

and
aaron
said
unto
the
king
behold
the

lordhas
called
him
another
way
he
has
gone
to
the
land

now
the
king
said
unto
them
what
is
this
that
ye
have
saidconcerning
the
spirit
of
the
lord

behold
this
is
the
thingwhich
doth
trouble

and
also
what
is
this
that
ammon
saidIf
ye
will
repent

be
saved
and
if
ye
will
not
repent
ye
shall
be
cast
offat

and
aaron
answered
him
and
said
unto
him
believest
thou
thatthere
is
a
god

and
the
king
said
I
know
that
the
amalekitessay
that
there

god

I
have
granted
unto
them
that

build

that
they
may
assemble
themselvestogether
to
worship
him

and
if
now
thou
sayest
there
is
a
godbehold
I
will
believealma


and
now
when
aaron
heard
this
his
heart
began
to
rejoice
andhe
said
behold
assuredly
as
thou
livest
o
king
there
is
agodalma


and
the
king
said
Is

that
great
spirit
that
brought
ourfathers
out
of
the
land

and
aaron
said
unto
him
yea
he
is
that
great
spirit

hecreated
all
things

in
heaven

and
he
said
yea
I
believe
that
the
great
spirit
created
allthings
and
I
desire
that
ye
should
tell
me
concerning
all
thesethings
and
I
will
believe
thy
wordsalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
aaron
saw
that
the
king
wouldbelieve
his
words
he
began
from
the
creation
of
adam
readingthe
scriptures
unto
the
kinghow
god
created
man
after

ownimage
and
that
god
gave
him

that
because
oftransgression
man
had
fallenalma


and
aaron
did
expound
unto
him
the
scriptures
from
thecreation
of
adam
laying
the
fall
of
man
before
him
and
theircarnal
state
and
also
the
plan
of
redemption
which
was
preparedfrom
the
foundation
of
the
world
through
christ
for
allwhosoever
would
believe
on
his
namealma


and
since
man
had
fallen
he
could
not
merit
anything
ofhimself
but
the
sufferings
and
death
of
christ
atone
for
theirsins
through
faith
and
repentance
and
so
forth
and
that
hebreaketh
the
bands
of
death
that
the
grave
shall
have
novictory
and
that
the
sting
of
death
should
be
swallowed
up
inthe
hopes
of
glory
and
aaron
did
expound
all
these
things
untothe
kingalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
aaron
had
expounded
thesethings
unto
him
the
king
said
what
shall
I
do
that
I
may
havethis
eternal
life
of
which
thou
hast
spoken

yea
what
shall
Ido
that
I
may
be
born
of
god
having
this
wicked
spirit
rootedout
of
my
breast
and
receive
his
spirit
that
I
may
be
filledwith
joy
that
I
may
not
be
cast
off
at
the
last
day

beholdsaid
he
I
will
give
up
all
that
I
possess
yea
I
will
forsakemy
kingdom
that
I
may
receive
this
great
joyalma


but
aaron
said
unto
him
If
thou
desirest
this
thing
if
thouwilt
bow
down
before
god
yea
if
thou
wilt
repent
of
all
thysins

will
bow
down
before

call
on
his
name
infaith
believing
that
ye
shall
receive

shalt
thou
receivethe
hope
which
thou
desirestalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
aaron
had
said
these
words
theking
did
bow
down
before
the
lord
upon
his
knees
yea
even
hedid
prostrate
himself
upon
the
earth
and
cried
mightily
sayingalma


o
god
aaron
hath
told
me
that
there
is
a

and
if
thereis
a
god
and
if
thou
art
god
wilt
thou
make
thyself
known
untome
and
I
will
give
away
all
my
sins
to
know
thee
and
that
I
maybe
raised
from
the
dead
and
be
saved
at
the
last
day

and
nowwhen
the
king
had
said
these
words
he
was
struck
as
if
he
weredeadalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
his
servants
ran
and
told
the
queenall
that
had
happened
unto
the
king

and
she
came
in
unto
theking
and
when
she
saw
him
lay
as
if
he
were
dead
and
also
aaronand
his
brethren
standing
as
though
they
had
been
the
cause
ofhis
fall
she
was
angry
with
them
and
commanded
that
herservants
or
the
servants
of
the
king
should
take
them
and
slaythemalma


now
the
servants
had
seen
the
cause
of
the
kings
falltherefore
they
durst
not
lay
their
hands
on
aaron
and
hisbrethren
and
they
pled
with
the
queen
saying
why
commandestthou
that
we
should
slay
these
men
when
behold
one
of
them
ismightier
than
us
all

therefore
we
shall
fall
before
themalma


now
when
the
queen
saw
the
fear
of
the
servants
she
alsobegan
to
fear
exceedingly
lest
there
should
some
evil
come
uponher

and
she
commanded
her
servants
that
they
should
go
and
callthe
people
that
they
might
slay
aaron
and
his
brethrenalma


now
when
aaron
saw
the
determination
of
the
queen
he
alsoknowing
the
hardness
of
the
hearts
of
the
people
feared
lestthat
a
multitude
should
assemble
themselves
together
and
thereshould
be
a
great
contention
and
a
disturbance
among
themtherefore
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
raised
the
king
from
theearth
and
said
unto
him
stand

and
he
stood
upon
his
feetreceiving
his
strengthalma


now
this
was
done
in
the
presence
of
the
queen
and
many
ofthe
servants

and
when
they
saw
it
they
greatly
marveled
andbegan
to
fear

and
the
king
stood
forth
and
began
to
ministerunto
them

and
he
did
minister
unto
them
insomuch
that
hiswhole
household
were
converted
unto
the
lordalma


now
there
was
a
multitude
gathered
together
because
of
thecommandment
of
the
queen
and
there
began
to
be
great
murmuringsamong
them
because
of
aaron
and
his
brethrenalma


but
the
king
stood
forth
among
them
and
administered
untothem

and
they
were
pacified
towards
aaron
and
those
who
werewith
himalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
king
saw
that
the
peoplewere
pacified
he
caused
that
aaron
and
his
brethren
should
standforth
in
the
midst
of
the
multitude
and
that
they
should
preachthe
word
unto
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
sent
a
proclamationthroughout
all
the
land
amongst
all
his
people
who
were
in
allhis
land
who
were
in
all
the
regions
round
about
which
wasbordering
even
to
the
sea
on
the
east
and
on
the
west
and
whichwas
divided
from
the
land
of
zarahemla
by
a
narrow
strip
ofwilderness
which
ran
from
the
sea
east
even
to
the
sea
west
andround
about
on
the
borders
of
the
seashore
and
the
borders
ofthe
wilderness
which
was
on
the
north
by
the
land
of
zarahemlathrough
the
borders
of
manti
by
the
head
of
the
river
sidonrunning
from
the
east
towards
the
westand
thus
were
thelamanites
and
the
nephites
dividedalma


now
the
more
idle
part
of
the
lamanites
lived
in
thewilderness
and
dwelt
in
tents
and
they
were
spread
through
thewilderness
on
the
west
in
the
land
of
nephi
yea
and
also
onthe
west
of
the
land
of
zarahemla
in
the
borders
by
theseashore
and
on
the
west
in
the
land
of
nephi
in
the
place
oftheir
fathers
first
inheritance
and
thus
bordering
along
by
theseashorealma


and
also
there
were
many
lamanites
on
the
east
by
theseashore
whither
the
nephites
had
driven
them

and
thus
thenephites
were
nearly
surrounded
by
the
lamanites
neverthelessthe
nephites
had
taken
possession
of
all
the
northern
parts
ofthe
land
bordering
on
the
wilderness
at
the
head
of
the
riversidon
from
the
east
to
the
west
round
about
on
the
wildernessside
on
the
north
even
until
they
came
to
the
land
which
theycalled
bountifulalma


and
it
bordered
upon
the
land
which
they
called
desolationit
being
so
far
northward
that
it
came
into
the
land
which
hadbeen
peopled
and
been
destroyed
of
whose
bones
we
have
spokenwhich
was
discovered
by
the
people
of
zarahemla
it
being
theplace
of
their
first
landingalma


and
they
came
from
there
up
into
the
south
wilderness

thusthe
land
on
the
northward
was
called
desolation
and
the
land
onthe
southward
was
called
bountiful
it
being
the
wilderness
whichis
filled
with
all
manner
of
wild
animals
of
every
kind
a
partof
which
had
come
from
the
land
northward
for
foodalma


and
now
it
was
only
the
distance
of
a
day
and
a
halfsjourney
for
a
nephite
on
the
line
bountiful
and
the
landdesolation
from
the
east
to
the
west
sea
and
thus
the
land
ofnephi
and
the
land
of
zarahemla
were
nearly
surrounded
by
waterthere
being
a
small
neck
of
land
between
the
land
northward
andthe
land
southwardalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
had
inhabited
the
landbountiful
even
from
the
east
unto
the
west
sea
and
thus
thenephites
in
their
wisdom
with
their
guards
and
their
armies
hadhemmed
in
the
lamanites
on
the
south
that
thereby
they
shouldhave
no
more
possession
on
the
north
that
they
might
not
overrunthe
land
northwardalma


therefore
the
lamanites
could
have
no
more
possessions
onlyin
the
land
of
nephi
and
the
wilderness
round
about

now
thiswas
wisdom
in
the
nephitesas
the
lamanites
were
an
enemy
tothem
they
would
not
suffer
their
afflictions
on
every
hand
andalso
that
they
might
have
a
country
whither
they
might
fleeaccording
to
their
desiresalma


and
now
I
after
having
said
this
return
again
to

of

aaron

and
their
brethrenalma
chapter
alma


behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
of
the
lamanitessent
a
proclamation
among
all
his
people
that
they
should
notlay
their
hands
on
ammon
or
aaron
or
omner
or
himni
noreither
of
their
brethren
who
should
go
forth
preaching
the
wordof
god
in
whatsoever
place
they
should
be
in
any
part
of
theirlandalma


yea
he
sent
a
decree
among
them
that
they
should
not
laytheir
hands
on
them
to
bind
them
or
to
cast
them
into
prisonneither
should
they
spit
upon
them
nor
smite
them
nor
cast
themout
of
their
synagogues
nor
scourge
them
neither
should
theycast
stones
at
them
but
that
they
should
have
free
access
totheir
houses
and
also
their
temples
and
their
sanctuariesalma


and
thus
they
might
go
forth
and
preach
the
word
according
totheir
desires
for
the
king
had
been
converted
unto
the
lord
andall
his
household
therefore
he
sent
his
proclamation
throughoutthe
land
unto
his
people
that
the
word
of
god
might
have
noobstruction
but
that
it
might
go
forth
throughout
all
the
landthat
his
people
might
be
convinced
concerning
the
wickedtraditions
of
their
fathers
and
that
they
might
be
convincedthat
they
were
all
brethren
and
that
they
ought
not
to
murdernor
to
plunder
nor
to
steal
nor
to
commit
adultery
nor
tocommit
any
manner
of
wickednessalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
king
had
sent
forth
thisproclamation
that
aaron
and
his
brethren
went
forth
from
city
tocity
and
from
one
house
of
worship
to
another
establishingchurches
and
consecrating
priests
and
teachers
throughout
theland
among
the
lamanites
to
preach
and
to
teach
the
word
of
godamong
them
and
thus
they
began
to
have
great
successalma


and
thousands
were
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
yeathousands
were
brought
to
believe
in
the
traditions
of
thenephites
and
they
were
taught
the
records
and
prophecies
whichwere
handed
down
even
to
the
present
timealma


and
as
sure
as
the

liveth
so
sure
as
many
as
believedor
as
many
as
were
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
throughthe
preaching
of
ammon
and
his
brethren
according
to
the
spiritof
revelation
and
of
prophecy
and
the
power
of
god
workingmiracles
in
themyea
I
say
unto
you
as
the
lord
liveth
asmany
of
the
lamanites
as
believed
in
their
preaching
and
wereconverted
unto
the
lord
never
did
fall
awayalma


for
they
became
a
righteous
people
they
did
lay
down
theweapons
of
their
rebellion
that
they
did
not
fight
against
godany
more
neither
against
any
of
their
brethrenalma


now
these
are
they
who
were
converted
unto
the
lordalma


the
people
of
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
land
of
Ishmaelalma


and
also
of
the
people
of
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
landof
middonialma


and
also
of
the
people
of
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
cityof
nephialma


and
also
of
the
people
of
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
landof
shilom
and
who
were
in
the
land
of
shemlon
and
in
the
cityof
lemuel
and
in
the
city
of
shimnilomalma


and
these
are
the
names
of
the
cities
of
the
lamanites
whichwere
converted
unto
the
lord
and
these
are
they
that
laid
downthe
weapons
of
their
rebellion
yea
all
their
weapons
of
warand
they
were
all
lamanitesalma


and
the
amalekites
were
not
converted
save
only
one
neitherwere
any
of
the
amulonites
but
they
did
harden
their
hearts
andalso
the
hearts
of
the
lamanites
in
that
part
of
the
landwheresoever
they
dwelt
yea
and
all
their
villages
and
all
theircitiesalma


therefore
we
have
named
all
the
cities
of
the
lamanites
inwhich
they
did
repent
and
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
andwere
convertedalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
and
those
who
wereconverted
were
desirous
that
they
might
have
a
name
that
therebythey
might
be
distinguished
from
their
brethren
therefore
theking
consulted
with
aaron
and
many
of
their
priests
concerningthe
name
that
they
should
take
upon
them
that
they
might
bedistinguishedalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
called
their
namesantinephilehies
and
they
were
called
by
this
name
and
were
nomore
called
lamanitesalma


and
they
began
to
be
a
very
industrious
people
yea
and
theywere
friendly
with
the
nephites
therefore
they
did
open
acorrespondence
with
them
and
the
curse
of
god
did
no
more

chapter
alma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
amalekites
and
the
amulonites
andthe
lamanites
who
were
in
the
land
of
amulon
and
also
in
theland
of
helam
and
who
were
in
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
infine
in
all
the
land
round
about
who
had
not
been
converted
andhad
not
taken
upon
them
the
name
of
antinephilehi
were
stirredup
by
the
amalekites
and
by
the
amulonites
to
anger
against
theirbrethrenalma


and
their
hatred
became
exceedingly
sore
against
them
eveninsomuch
that
they
began
to
rebel
against
their
king
insomuchthat
they
would
not
that
he
should
be
their
king
therefore
theytook
up
arms
against
the
people
of
antinephilehialma


now
the
king
conferred
the
kingdom
upon
his
son
and
he
calledhis
name
antinephilehialma


and
the
king
died
in
that
selfsame
year
that
the
lamanitesbegan
to
make
preparations
for
war
against
the
people
of
godalma


now
when
ammon
and
his
brethren
and
all
those
who
had
come
upwith
him
saw
the
preparations
of
the
lamanites
to
destroy
theirbrethren
they
came
forth
to
the
land
of
midian
and
there
ammonmet
all
his
brethren
and
from
thence
they
came
to
the
land
ofIshmael
that
they
might
hold
a
council
with
lamoni
and
also
withhis
brother
antinephilehi
what
they
should
do
to
defendthemselves
against
the
lamanitesalma


now
there
was
not
one
soul
among
all
the
people
who
had
beenconverted
unto
the
lord
that
would
take
up
arms
against
theirbrethren
nay
they
would
not
even
make
any
preparations
for
waryea
and
also
their
king
commanded
them
that
they
should
notalma


now
these
are
the
words
which
he
said
unto
the
peopleconcerning
the
matter
I
thank
my
god
my
beloved
people
thatour
great
god
has
in
goodness
sent
these
our
brethren
thenephites
unto
us
to
preach
unto
us
and
to
convince
us
of
thetraditions
of
our
wicked
fathersalma


and
behold
I
thank
my
great
god
that
he
has
given
us
aportion
of
his
spirit
to
soften
our
hearts
that
we
have
opened
acorrespondence
with
these
brethren
the
nephitesalma


and
behold
I
also
thank
my
god
that
by
opening
thiscorrespondence
we
have
been
convinced
of
our
sins
and
of
themany
murders
which
we
have
committedalma


and
I
also
thank
my
god
yea
my
great
god
that
he
hathgranted
unto
us
that
we
might
repent
of
these
things
and
alsothat
he
hath
forgiven
us
of
those
our
many
sins
and
murders
whichwe
have
committed
and
taken
away
the
guilt
from
our
heartsthrough
the
merits
of
his
sonalma


and
now
behold
my
brethren
since
it
has
been
all
that
wecould
do
as
we
were
the
most
lost
of
all
mankind
to
repent
ofall
our
sins
and
the
many
murders
which
we
have
committed
and
toget
god
to
take
them
away
from
our
hearts
for
it
was
all
wecould
do
to
repent
sufficiently
before
god
that
he
would
takeaway
our
stainalma


now
my
best
beloved
brethren
since
god
hath
taken
away
ourstains
and
our
swords
have
become
bright
then
let
us
stain
ourswords
no
more
with
the
blood
of
our
brethrenalma


behold
I
say
unto
you
nay
let
us
retain
our
swords
thatthey
be
not
stained
with
the
blood
of
our
brethren
for
perhapsif
we
should
stain
our
swords
again
they
can
no
more
be
washedbright
through
the
blood
of
the
son
of
our
great
god
which
shallbe
shed
for
the
atonement
of
our
sinsalma


and
the
great
god
has
had
mercy
on
us
and
made
these
thingsknown
unto
us
that
we
might
not
perish
yea
and
he
has
madethese
things
known
unto
us
beforehand
because
he
loveth
oursouls
as
well
as
he
loveth
our
children
therefore
in
his
mercyhe
doth
visit
us
by
his
angels
that
the
plan
of
salvation
mightbe
made
known
unto
us
as
well
as
unto
future
generationsalma


oh
how
merciful
is
our
god

and
now
behold
since
it
hasbeen
as
much
as
we
could
do
to
get
our
stains
taken
away
from
usand
our
swords
are
made
bright
let
us
hide
them
away
that
theymay
be
kept
bright
as
a
testimony
to
our
god
at
the
last
day
orat
the
day
that
we
shall
be
brought
to
stand
before
him
to
bejudged
that
we
have
not
stained
our
swords
in
the
blood
of
ourbrethren
since
he
imparted
his
word
unto
us
and
has
made
us
cleantherebyalma


and
now
my
brethren
if
our
brethren
seek
to
destroy
usbehold
we
will
hide
away
our
swords
yea
even
we
will
bury
themdeep
in
the
earth
that
they
may
be
kept
bright
as
a
testimonythat
we
have
never
used
them
at
the
last
day
and
if
ourbrethren
destroy
us
behold
we
shall
go
to
our
god
and
shall
besavedalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
king
had
made
an
end
ofthese
sayings
and
all
the
people
were
assembled
together
theytook
their
swords
and
all
the
weapons
which
were
used
for
theshedding
of
mans
blood
and
they
did
bury
them
up
deep
in
theearthalma


and
this
they
did
it
being
in
their
view
a
testimony
to
godand
also
to
men
that
they
never
would
use
weapons
again
for
theshedding
of
mans
blood
and
this
they
did
vouching
andcovenanting
with
god
that
rather
than
shed
the
blood
of
theirbrethren
they
would
give
up
their
own
lives
and
rather
than
takeaway
from
a
brother
they
would
give
unto
him
and
rather
thanspend
their
days
in
idleness
they
would
labor
abundantly
withtheir
handsalma


and
thus
we
see
that
when
these
lamanites
were
brought
tobelieve
and
to
know
the
truth
they
were
firm
and
would
suffereven
unto
death
rather
than
commit
sin
and
thus
we
see
that
theyburied
their
weapons
of
peace
or
they
buried
the
weapons
of
warfor
peacealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
their
brethren
the
lamanites
madepreparations
for
war
and
came
up
to
the
land
of
nephi
for
thepurpose
of
destroying
the
king
and
to
place
another
in
hisstead
and
also
of
destroying
the
people
of
antinephilehi
outof
the
landalma


now
when
the
people
saw
that
they
were
coming
against
themthey
went
out
to
meet
them
and
prostrated
themselves
before
themto
the
earth
and
began
to
call
on
the
name
of
the
lord
and
thusthey
were
in
this
attitude
when
the
lamanites
began
to
fall
uponthem
and
began
to
slay
them
with
the
swordalma


and
thus
without
meeting
any
resistance
they
did
slay
athousand
and
five
of
them
and
we
know
that
they
are
blessed
forthey
have
gone
to
dwell
with
their
godalma


now
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
their
brethren
would
not
fleefrom
the
sword
neither
would
they
turn
aside
to
the
right
handor
to
the
left
but
that
they
would
lie
down
and
perish
andpraised
god
even
in
the
very
act
of
perishing
under
the
swordalma


now
when
the
lamanites
saw
this
they
did
forbear
from
slayingthem
and
there
were
many
whose
hearts
had
swollen
in
them
forthose
of
their
brethren
who
had
fallen
under
the
sword
for
theyrepented
of
the
things
which
they
had
donealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
threw
down
their
weapons
ofwar
and
they
would
not
take
them
again
for
they
were
stung
forthe
murders
which
they
had
committed
and
they
came
down
even
astheir
brethren
relying
upon
the
mercies
of
those
whose
arms
werelifted
to
slay
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
god
were
joined
thatday
by
more
than
the
number
who
had
been
slain
and
those
who
hadbeen
slain
were
righteous
people
therefore
we
have
no
reason
todoubt
but
what
they
were
savedalma


and
there
was
not
a
wicked
man
slain
among
them
but
therewere
more
than
a
thousand
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truththus
we
see
that
the
lord
worketh
in
many
ways
to
the
salvationof
his
peoplealma


now
the
greatest
number
of
those
of
the
lamanites
who
slew
somany
of
their
brethren
were
amalekites
and
amulonites
thegreatest
number
of
whom
were
after
the
order
of
the
nehorsalma


now
among
those
who
joined
the
people
of
the
lord
therewere
none
who
were
amalekites
or
amulonites
or
who
were
of
theorder
of
nehor
but
they
were
actual
descendants
of
laman
andlemuelalma


and
thus
we
can
plainly
discern
that
after
a
people
havebeen
once
enlightened
by
the
spirit
of
god
and
have
had
greatknowledge
of
things
pertaining
to
righteousness
and
then
havefallen
away
into
sin
and
transgression
they
become
morehardened
and
thus
their
state
becomes
worse
than
though
they
hadnever
known
these
thingsalma
chapter
alma


and
behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
those
lamanites
were
moreangry
because
they
had
slain
their
brethren
therefore
they
sworevengeance
upon
the
nephites
and
they
did
no
more
attempt
to
slaythe
people
of
antinephilehi
at
that
timealma


but
they
took
their
armies
and
went
over
into
the
borders
ofthe
land
of
zarahemla
and
fell
upon
the
people
who
were
in
theland
of
ammonihah
and
destroyed
themalma


and
after
that
they
had
many
battles
with
the
nephites
inthe
which
they
were
driven
and
slainalma


and
among
the
lamanites
who
were
slain
were
almost
all
theseed
of
amulon
and
his
brethren
who
were
the
priests
of
noahand
they
were
slain
by
the
hands
of
the
nephitesalma


and
the
remainder
having
fled
into
the
east
wilderness
andhaving
usurped
the
power
and
authority
over
the
lamanites
causedthat
many
of
the
lamanites
should
perish
by
fire
because
of
theirbeliefalma


for
many
of
them
after
having
suffered
much
loss
and
so
manyafflictions
began
to
be
stirred
up
in
remembrance
of
the
wordswhich
aaron
and
his
brethren
had
preached
to
them
in
their
landtherefore
they
began
to
disbelieve
the
traditions
of
theirfathers
and
to
believe
in
the
lord
and
that
he
gave
great
powerunto
the
nephites
and
thus
there
were
many
of
them
converted
inthe
wildernessalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
rulers
who
were
the
remnant
ofthe
children
of
amulon
caused
that
they
should
be
put
to
deathyea
all
those
that
believed
in
these
thingsalma


now
this
martyrdom
caused
that
many
of
their
brethren
shouldbe
stirred
up
to
anger
and
there
began
to
be
contention
in
thewilderness
and
the
lamanites
began
to
hunt
the
seed
of
amulonand
his
brethren
and
began
to
slay
them
and
they
fled
into
theeast
wildernessalma


and
behold
they
are
hunted
at
this
day
by
the
lamanites

thusthe
words
of
abinadi
were
brought
to
pass
which
he
saidconcerning
the
seed
of
the
priests
who
caused
that
he
shouldsuffer
death
by
firealma


for
he
said
unto
them
what
ye
shall
do
unto
me
shall
be
atype
of
things
to
comealma


and
now
abinadi
was
the
first
that
suffered
death
by
firebecause
of
his
belief
in
god
now
this
is
what
he
meant
thatmany
should
suffer
death
by
fire
according
as
he
had
sufferedalma


and
he
said
unto
the
priests
of
noah
that
their
seed
shouldcause
many
to
be
put
to
death
in
the
like
manner
as
he
was
andthat
they
should
be
scattered
abroad
and
slain
even
as
a
sheephaving
no
shepherd
is
driven
and
slain
by
wild
beasts
and
nowbehold
these
words
were
verified
for
they
were
driven
by
thelamanites
and
they
were
hunted
and
they
were
smittenalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
theycould
not
overpower
the
nephites
they
returned
again
to
their
ownland
and
many
of
them
came
over
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
Ishmaeland
the
land
of
nephi
and
did
join
themselves
to
the
people
ofgod
who
were
the
people
of
antinephilehialma


and
they
did
also
bury
their
weapons
of
war
according
astheir
brethren
had
and
they
began
to
be
a
righteous
people
andthey
did
walk
in
the
ways
of
the
lord
and
did
observe
to
keephis
commandments
and
his
statutesalma


yea
and
they
did
keep
the
law
of
moses
for
it
was
expedientthat
they
should
keep
the
law
of
moses
as
yet
for
it
was
not
allfulfilled

but
notwithstanding
the
law
of
moses
they
did
lookforward
to
the
coming
of
christ
considering
that
the
law
ofmoses
was
a
type
of
his
coming
and
believing
that
they
must
keepthose
outward
performances
until
the
time
that
he
should
berevealed
unto
themalma


now
they
did
not
suppose
that
salvation
came
by
the
law
ofmoses
but
the
law
of
moses
did
serve
to
strengthen
their
faithin
christ
and
thus
they
did
retain
a
hope
through
faith
untoeternal
salvation
relying
upon
the
spirit
of
prophecy
whichspake
of
those
things
to
comealma


and
now
behold
ammon
and
aaron
and
omner
and
himni
andtheir
brethren
did
rejoice
exceedingly
for
the
success
whichthey
had
had
among
the
lamanites
seeing
that
the
lord
hadgranted
unto
them
according
to
their
prayers
and
that
he
hadalso
verified
his
word
unto
them
in
every
particularalma
chapter

and
now
these
are
the
words
of
ammon
to
his
brethren
whichsay
thus
my
brothers
and
my
brethren
behold
I
say
unto
you
howgreat
reason
have
we
to
rejoice
for
could
we
have
supposed
whenwe
started
from
the
land
of
zarahemla
that
god
would
have
grantedunto
us
such
great
blessingsalma


and
now
I
ask
what
great
blessings
has
he
bestowed
upon
us
can
ye
tellalma


behold
I
answer
for
you
for
our
brethren
the
lamaniteswere
in

yea
even
in
the
darkest
abyss
but
behold
howmany
of
them
are
brought
to
behold
the
marvelous
light
of
god
and
this
is
the
blessing
which
hath
been
bestowed
upon
us
thatwe
have
been
made
instruments
in
the
hands
of
god
to
bring
aboutthis
great
workalma


behold
thousands
of
them
do
rejoice
and
have
been
broughtinto

behold

been
racked
with
hatred
against

and
theywould
also
have
been
strangers

and
it
came
to

that
when
ammon

said
these
words
hisbrother
aaron
rebuked
him
saying
ammon
I
fear
that
thy
joydoth

thousands
of
our

has
he
loosed
fromthe
pains
of

they
are
brought
to
sing

loveand
this
because
of
the
power
of
his
word
which
is
in

have
we
not
great
reason
to
rejoicealma


yea
we
have
reason
to
praise
him
forever

he
is
the
mosthigh
god
and
has
loosed
our
brethren
from
the
chains
of

yea
they
were
encircled
about
with

darkness
anddestruction

behold
he
has
brought

into
everlasting
salvation
and
they
are
encircledabout

the
matchless
bounty
of

much

behold
I
say
untoyou
I
cannot
say
the
smallest
part
which
I
feelalma


who
could
have
supposed
that
our
god
would
have
been
somerciful
as
to
have
snatched
us
from
our
awful
sinful
andpolluted
statealma


behold
we
went
forth
even
in
wrath
with
mighty
threateningsto
destroy
his
churchalma


oh
then
why
did
he
not
consign
us
to
an
awful
destructionyea
why
did
he
not
let
the
sword
of
his
justice
fall
upon
usand
doom
us
to
eternal
despairalma


oh
my
soul
almost
as
it
were
fleeth
at
the
thought
behold
he
did
not
exercise
his
justice
upon
us
but
in
his
greatmercy
hath
brought
us
over
that
everlasting
gulf
of
death
andmisery
even
to
the
salvation
of
our
soulsalma


and
now
behold
my
brethren
what
natural
man
is
there
thatknoweth
these
things

I
say
unto
you
there
is
none
that
knoweththese
things
save
it
be
the
penitentalma


yea
he
that
repenteth
and
exerciseth
faith
and
bringethforth
good
works
and
prayeth
continually
without
ceasinguntosuch
it
is
given
to
know

given

reveal
things
which
never
have
been
revealedyea
and
it
shall
be
given
unto
such
to
bring
thousands
of
soulsto
repentance
even
as
it
has
been
given
unto
us
to
bring
theseour
brethren
to
repentancealma


now
do
ye
remember
my
brethren
that
we
said
unto
ourbrethren
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
we
go
up
to
the
land
of
nephito
preach
unto
our
brethren
the
lamanites
and
they
laughed
usto
scornalma


for
they
said
unto
us
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
can
bring
thelamanites
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth

do
ye
suppose
that
yecan
convince
the
lamanites
of
the
incorrectness
of
the
traditionsof
their
fathers
as
stiffnecked
a
people
as
they
are
whosehearts
delight
in
the
shedding
of
blood
whose
days
have
beenspent
in
the
grossest
iniquity
whose
ways
have
been
the
ways
ofa
transgressor
from
the
beginning

now
my
brethren
ye
rememberthat
this
was
their
languagealma


and
moreover
they
did
say
let
us
take
up
arms
against
themthat
we
destroy
them
and
their
iniquity
out
of
the
land
lestthey
overrun
us
and
destroy
usalma


but
behold
my
beloved
brethren
we
came
into
the
wildernessnot
with
the
intent
to
destroy
our
brethren
but
with
the
intentthat
perhaps
we
might
save
some
few
of
their
soulsalma


now
when
our
hearts
were
depressed
and
we
were
about
to
turnback
behold
the
lord
comforted
us
and
said
go
amongst
thybrethren
the
lamanites
and
bear
with
patience
thineafflictions
and
I
will
give
unto
you
successalma


and
now
behold
we
have
come
and
been
forth
amongst
themand
we
have
been
patient
in
our
sufferings
and
we
have
sufferedevery
privation
yea
we
have
traveled
from
house
to
houserelying
upon
the
mercies
of
the
worldnot
upon
the
mercies
ofthe
world
alone
but
upon
the
mercies
of
godalma


and
we
have
entered
into
their
houses
and
taught
them
and
wehave
taught
them
in
their
streets
yea
and
we
have
taught
themupon
their
hills
and
we
have
also
entered
into
their
temples
andtheir
synagogues
and
taught
them
and
we
have
been
cast
out
andmocked
and
spit
upon
and
smote
upon
our
cheeks
and
we
havebeen
stoned
and
taken
and
bound
with
strong
cords
and
cast
intoprison
and
through
the
power
and
wisdom
of
god
we
have
beendelivered
againalma


and
we
have
suffered
all
manner
of
afflictions
and
all
thisthat
perhaps
we
might
be
the
means
of
saving
some
soul
and
wesupposed
that
our
joy
would
be
full
if
perhaps
we
could
be
themeans
of
saving
somealma


now
behold
we
can
look
forth
and
see
the
fruits
of
ourlabors
and
are
they
few

I
say
unto
you
nay
they
are
manyyea
and
we
can
witness
of
their
sincerity
because
of
their
lovetowards
their
brethren
and
also
towards
usalma


for
behold
they
had
rather
sacrifice
their
lives
than
evento
take
the
life
of
their
enemy
and
they
have
buried
theirweapons
of
war
deep
in
the
earth
because
of
their
love
towardstheir
brethrenalma


and
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
has
there
been
so
great
lovein
all
the
land

behold
I
say
unto
you
nay
there
has
noteven
among
the
nephitesalma


for
behold
they
would
take
up
arms
against
their
brethrenthey
would
not
suffer
themselves
to
be
slain

but
behold
howmany
of
these
have
laid
down
their
lives
and
we
know
that
theyhave
gone
to
their
god
because
of
their
love
and
of
their
hatredto
sinalma


now
have
we
not
reason
to
rejoice

yea
I
say
unto
youthere
never
were
men
that
had
so
great
reason
to
rejoice
as
wesince
the
world
began
yea
and
my
joy
is
carried
away
even
untoboasting
in
my
god
for
he
has
all
power
all
wisdom
and
allunderstanding
he
comprehendeth
all
things
and
he
is
a
mercifulbeing
even
unto
salvation

met

the

and
now
it
came

conducted

backto

to

they
wentand
told

land
nephi
that
we
may
protect
our
brethren
in
the
landjershon

this
we
do
for
our
brethren
on
account
of
theirfear
to
take
up
arms
against
their
brethren
lest
they
shouldcommit
sin
and
this
their
great
fear
came
because
of
their
sorerepentance
which
they
had
on
account
of
their
many
murders
andtheir
awful
wickednessalma


and
now
behold
this
will
we
do
unto

theymay
inherit

aportion

we
may
maintain

now
it
came
to

that
when
ammon
had
heard
this
hereturned
to
the
people
of
antinephilehi

also

withhim
into
the
wilderness

they
had
pitched

known
unto

all
these

and
alma
also
relatedunto
them
his
conversion
with
ammon

aaron
and
his
brethrenalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
it
did
cause
great
joy
among
them
and
they
went
down
into
the
land
of
jershon
and
took
possessionof
the
land
of
jershon
and
they
were
called
by
the
nephites
thepeople
of
ammon
therefore
they
were
distinguished
by
that
nameever
afteralma


and
they
were
among
the
people
of
nephi

also
numberedamong
the
people
who
were
of
the
church

and
they
werealso
distinguished
for
their
zeal
towards
god
and
also
towardsmen
for
they
were
perfectly
honest
and
upright
in
all
thingsand
they
were
firm
in
the
faith
of
christ
even
unto
the
endalma


and
they
did
look
upon
shedding
the
blood
of
their
brethrenwith
the
greatest
abhorrence
and
they
never
could
be
prevailedupon
to
take
up
arms
against
their
brethren
and
they
never
didlook
upon
death
with
any
degree
of
terror
for
their
hope
andviews
of
christ
and
the
resurrection
therefore
death
wasswallowed
up
to
them
by
the
victory
of
christ
over
italma


therefore
they
would
suffer
death
in
the
most
aggravatingand
distressing
manner
which
could
be
inflicted
by
theirbrethren
before
they
would
take
the
sword
or

thus
they
were
a
zealous

beloved
people

now
it
came
to

establishedin

behold
the
armies
of

lamaniteshad
followed
their

into
the
wildernessalma


and
thus
there
was
a
tremendous
battle
yea
even
such
an
oneas
never
had
been
known
among

the

and
also
there
was
a
tremendous
slaughter

the
lamanites
were
driven

the
people
of
nephi
returned

and
now
this
was
a
time
that
there
was
a
great
mourning

heard
throughout

peopleof

the
cry
of

mourning

mourning
for
their
sons

the
daughter
for

the

thus
the
cry
ofmourning
was
heard
among
all
of

mourning
for
their
kindredwho
had
been

and
now
surely
this
was
a
sorrowful
day
yea
a
time
ofsolemnity

a
time
of
much
fasting

prayeralma

thus

the
fifteenth

the
account

in

their
sufferings

sorrows

their
afflictions

their

the
reception

now
may
the
lord

redeemer

all

and
this
is
the
account
of
the
wars
and
contentions
among
thenephites

also
the
wars
between
the
nephites
and
thelamanites
and
the
fifteenth
year
of

reign

and
from
the
first
year
to
the
fifteenth
has
brought
to
passthe
destruction
of
many
thousand
lives
yea
it
has
brought
topass
an
awful
scene
of
bloodshedalma


and
the
bodies
of
many
thousands
are
laid
low
in
the
earthwhile
the
bodies
of
many
thousands
are
moldering
in
heaps
uponthe
face
of
the
earth

and
many
thousands
are
mourning
forthe
loss
of
their
kindred
because
they
have
reason
to
fearaccording
to
the
promises
of
the
lord
that
they
are
consigned

state
of
endless
woalma


while
many
thousands
of
others
truly
mourn
for
the
loss
oftheir
kindred
yet
they
rejoice

exult
in
the
hope

thus
we

how
great
the
inequality

the
power
of
the

cunning

thus
we
see
the
great
call
of
diligence
of
men
to
laborin
the
vineyards
of

thus
we
see
the
great
reason

overthe
people
of
nephi
there
began
to
be
continual
peace
throughoutall
the
landalma


yea
and
the
people
did
observe
to
keep
the
commandments
ofthe
lord
and
they
were
strict
in
observing
the
ordinances
ofgod
according
to
the
law
of
moses
for
they
were
taught
to
keepthe
law
of
moses
until
it
should
be
fulfilledalma


and
thus
the
people
did
have
no
disturbance
in
all
thesixteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
ofnephialma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
commencement
of
theseventeenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
there
was
continualpeacealma


but
it
came
to
pass
in
the
latter
end
of
the
seventeenth
yearthere
came
a
man
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
he
wasantichrist
for
he
began
to
preach
unto
the
people
against
theprophecies
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
prophets
concerning
thecoming
of
christalma


now
there
was
no
law
against
a
mans
belief
for
it
wasstrictly
contrary
to
the
commands
of
god
that
there
should
be
alaw
which
should
bring
men
on
to
unequal
groundsalma


for
thus
saith
the
scripture
choose
ye
this
day
whom
ye
willservealma


now
if
a
man
desired
to
serve
god
it
was
his
privilege
orrather
if
he
believed
in
god
it
was
his
privilege
to
serve
himbut
if
he
did
not
believe
in
him
there
was
no
law
to
punish
himalma


but
if
he
murdered
he
was
punished
unto
death
and
if
herobbed
he
was
also
punished
and
if
he
stole
he
was
alsopunished
and
if
he
committed
adultery
he
was
also
punished
yeafor
all
this
wickedness
they
were
punishedalma


for
there
was
a
law
that
men
should
be
judged
according
totheir
crimes

nevertheless
there
was
no
law
against
a
mansbelief
therefore
a
man
was
punished
only
for
the
crimes
whichhe
had
done
therefore
all
men
were
on
equal
groundsalma


and
this
antichrist
whose
name
was
korihor
and
the
lawcould
have
no
hold
upon
him
began
to
preach
unto
the
people
thatthere
should
be
no
christ

and
after
this
manner
did
he
preachsayingalma


o
ye
that
are
bound
down
under
a
foolish
and
a
vain
hope
whydo
ye
yoke
yourselves
with
such
foolish
things

why
do
ye
lookfor
a
christ

for
no
man
can
know
of
anything
which
is
to
comealma


behold
these
things
which
ye
call
prophecies
which
ye
sayare
handed
down
by
holy
prophets
behold
they
are
foolishtraditions
of
your
fathersalma


how
do
ye
know
of
their
surety

behold
ye
cannot
know
ofthings
which
ye
do
not
see
therefore
ye
cannot
know
that
thereshall
be
a
christalma


ye
look
forward
and
say
that
ye
see
a
remission
of
your
sinsbut
behold
it
is
the
effect
of
a
frenzied
mind
and
thisderangement
of
your
minds
comes
because
of
the
traditions
of
yourfathers
which
lead
you
away
into
a
belief
of
things
which
arenot
soalma


and
many
more
such
things
did
he
say
unto
them
telling
themthat
there
could
be
no
atonement
made
for
the
sins
of
men
butevery
man
fared
in
this
life
according
to
the
management
of
thecreature
therefore
every
man
prospered
according
to
his
geniusand
that
every
man
conquered
according
to
his
strength
andwhatsoever
a
man
did
was
no
crimealma


and
thus
he
did
preach
unto
them
leading
away
the
hearts
ofmany
causing
them
to
lift
up
their
heads
in
their
wickednessyea
leading
away
many
women
and
also
men
to
commitwhoredomstelling
them
that
when
a
man
was
dead
that
was
theend
thereofalma


now
this
man
went
over
to
the
land
of
jershon
also
to
preachthese
things
among
the
people
of
ammon
who
were
once
the
peopleof
the
lamanitesalma


but
behold
they
were
more
wise
than
many
of
the
nephites
forthey
took
him
and
bound
him
and
carried
him
before
ammon
whowas
a
high
priest
over
that
peoplealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
caused
that
he
should
be
carriedout
of
the
land

and
he
came
over
into
the
land
of
gideon
andbegan
to
preach
unto
them
also
and
here
he
did
not
have
muchsuccess
for
he
was
taken
and
bound
and
carried
before
the
highpriest
and
also
the
chief
judge
over
the
landalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
high
priest
said
unto
him
whydo
ye
go
about
perverting
the
ways
of
the
lord

why
do
ye
teachthis
people
that
there
shall
be
no
christ
to
interrupt
theirrejoicings

why
do
ye
speak
against
all
the
prophecies
of
theholy
prophetsalma


now
the
high
priests
name
was
giddonah

and
korihor
saidunto
him
because
I
do
not
teach
the
foolish
traditions
of
yourfathers
and
because
I
do
not
teach
this
people
to
bindthemselves
down
under
the
foolish
ordinances
and
performanceswhich
are
laid
down
by
ancient
priests
to
usurp
power
andauthority
over
them
to
keep
them
in
ignorance
that
they
may
notlift
up
their
heads
but
be
brought
down
according
to
thy
wordsalma


ye
say
that
this
people
is
a
free
people

behold
I
say
theyare
in
bondage

ye
say
that
those
ancient
prophecies
are
true
behold
I
say
that
ye
do
not
know
that
they
are
truealma


ye
say
that
this
people
is
a
guilty
and
a
fallen
peoplebecause
of
the
transgression
of
a
parent

behold
I
say
that
achild
is
not
guilty
because
of
its
parentsalma


and
ye
also
say
that
christ
shall
come

but
behold
I
saythat
ye
do
not
know
that
there
shall
be
a
christ

and
ye
sayalso
that
he
shall
be
slain
for
the
sins
of
the
worldalma


and
thus
ye
lead
away
this
people
after
the
foolishtraditions
of
your
fathers
and
according
to
your
own
desiresand
ye
keep
them
down
even
as
it
were
in
bondage
that
ye
mayglut
yourselves
with
the
labors
of
their
hands
that
they
durstnot
look
up
with
boldness
and
that
they
durst
not
enjoy
theirrights
and
privilegesalma


yea
they
durst
not
make
use
of
that
which
is
their
own
lestthey
should
offend
their
priests
who
do
yoke
them
according
totheir
desires
and
have
brought
them
to
believe
by
theirtraditions
and
their
dreams
and
their
whims
and
their
visions
andtheir
pretended
mysteries
that
they
should
if
they
did
not
doaccording
to
their
words
offend
some
unknown
being
who
they
sayis
goda
being
who
never
has
been
seen
or
known
who
never
wasnor
ever
will
bealma


now
when
the
high
priest
and
the
chief
judge
saw
the
hardnessof
his
heart
yea
when
they
saw
that
he
would
revile
evenagainst
god
they
would
not
make
any
reply
to
his
words
but
theycaused
that
he
should
be
bound
and
they
delivered
him
up
intothe
hands
of
the
officers
and
sent
him
to
the
land
of
zarahemlathat
he
might
be
brought
before
alma
and
the
chief
judge
who
wasgovernor
over
all
the
landalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
was
brought
before
alma
andthe
chief
judge
he
did
go
on
in
the
same
manner
as
he
did
in
theland
of
gideon
yea
he
went
on
to
blasphemealma


and
he
did
rise
up
in
great
swelling
words
before
alma
anddid
revile
against
the
priests
and
teachers
accusing
them
ofleading
away
the
people
after
the
silly
traditions
of
theirfathers
for
the
sake
of
glutting
on
the
labors
of
the
peoplealma


now
alma
said
unto
him
thou
knowest
that
we
do
not
glutourselves
upon
the
labors
of
this
people
for
behold
I
havelabored
even
from
the
commencement
of
the
reign
of
the
judgesuntil
now
with
mine
own
hands
for
my
support
notwithstanding
mymany
travels
round
about
the
land
to
declare
the
word
of
god
untomy
peoplealma


and
notwithstanding
the
many
labors
which
I
have
performed
inthe
church
I
have
never
received
so
much
as
even
one
senine
formy
labor
neither
has
any
of
my
brethren
save
it
were
in
thejudgmentseat
and
then
we
have
received
only
according
to
lawfor
our
timealma


and
now
if
we
do
not
receive
anything
for
our
labors
in
thechurch
what
doth
it
profit
us
to
labor
in
the
church
save
itwere
to
declare
the
truth
that
we
may
have
rejoicings
in
the
joyof
our
brethrenalma


then
why
sayest
thou
that
we
preach
unto
this
people
to
getgain
when
thou
of
thyself
knowest
that
we
receive
no
gain
and
now
believest
thou
that
we
deceive
this
people
that
causessuch
joy
in
their
heartsalma


and
korihor
answered
him
yeaalma


and
then
alma
said
unto
him
believest
thou
that
there
is
agodalma


and
he
answered
nayalma


now
alma
said
unto
him
will
ye
deny
again
that
there
is
agod
and
also
deny
the
christ

for
behold
I
say
unto
you
Iknow
there
is
a
god
and
also
that
christ
shall
comealma


and
now
what
evidence
have
ye
that
there
is
no
god
or
thatchrist
cometh
not

I
say
unto
you
that
ye
have
none
save
it
beyour
word
onlyalma


but
behold
I
have
all
things
as
a
testimony
that
thesethings
are
true
and
ye
also
have
all
things
as
a
testimony
untoyou
that
they
are
true
and
will
ye
deny
them

believest
thouthat
these
things
are
truealma


behold
I
know
that
thou
believest
but
thou
art
possessedwith
a
lying
spirit
and
ye
have
put
off
the
spirit
of
god
thatit
may
have
no
place
in
you
but
the
devil
has
power
over
youand
he
doth
carry
you
about
working
devices
that
he
may
destroythe
children
of
godalma


and
now
korihor
said
unto
alma
If
thou
wilt
show
me
a
signthat
I
may
be
convinced
that
there
is
a
god
yea
show
unto
methat
he
hath
power
and
then
will
I
be
convinced
of
the
truth
ofthy
wordsalma


but
alma
said
unto
him
thou
hast
had
signs
enough
will
yetempt
your
god

will
ye
say
show
unto
me
a
sign
when
ye
havethe
testimony
of
all
these
thy
brethren
and
also
all
the
holyprophets

the
scriptures
are
laid
before
thee
yea
and
allthings
denote
there
is
a
god
yea
even
the
earth
and
all
thingsthat
are
upon
the
face
of
it
yea
and
its
motion
yea
and
alsoall
the
planets
which
move
in
their
regular
form
do
witness
thatthere
is
a
supreme
creatoralma


and
yet
do
ye
go
about
leading
away
the
hearts
of
thispeople
testifying
unto
them
there
is
no
god

and
yet
will
yedeny
against
all
these
witnesses

and
he
said
yea
I
will
denyexcept
ye
shall
show
me
a
signalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
said
unto
him
behold
I
amgrieved
because
of
the
hardness
of
your
heart
yea
that
ye
willstill
resist
the
spirit
of
the
truth
that
thy
soul
may
bedestroyedalma


but
behold
it
is
better
that
thy
soul
should
be
lost
thanthat
thou
shouldst
be
the
means
of
bringing
many
souls
down
todestruction
by
thy
lying
and
by
thy
flattering
words
thereforeif
thou
shalt
deny
again
behold
god
shall
smite
thee
that
thoushalt
become
dumb
that
thou
shalt
never
open
thy
mouth
any
morethat
thou
shalt
not
deceive
this
people
any
morealma


now
korihor
said
unto
him
I
do
not
deny
the
existence
of
agod
but
I
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
god
and
I
say
alsothat
ye
do
not
know
that
there
is
a
god
and
except
ye
show
me
asign
I
will
not
believealma


now
alma
said
unto
him
this
will
I
give
unto
thee
for
asign
that
thou
shalt
be
struck
dumb
according
to
my
words
andI
say
that
in
the
name
of
god
ye
shall
be
struck
dumb
that
yeshall
no
more
have
utterancealma


now
when
alma
had
said
these
words
korihor
was
struck
dumbthat
he
could
not
have
utterance
according
to
the
words
of
almaalma


and
now
when
the
chief
judge
saw
this
he
put
forth
his
handand
wrote
unto
korihor
saying
art
thou
convinced
of
the
powerof
god

In
whom
did
ye
desire
that
alma
should
show
forth
hissign

would
ye
that
he
should
afflict
others
to
show
unto
theea
sign

behold
he
has
showed
unto
you
a
sign
and
now
will
yedispute
morealma


and
korihor
put
forth
his
hand
and
wrote
saying
I
know
thatI
am
dumb
for
I
cannot
speak
and
I
know
that
nothing
save
itwere
the
power
of
god
could
bring
this
upon
me
yea
and
I
alwaysknew
that
there
was
a
godalma


but
behold
the
devil
hath
deceived
me
for
he
appeared
untome
in
the
form
of
an
angel
and
said
unto
me
go
and
reclaim
thispeople
for
they
have
all
gone
astray
after
an
unknown
god

andhe
said
unto
me
there
is
no
god
yea
and
he
taught
me
thatwhich
I
should
say

and
I
have
taught
his
words
and
I
taughtthem
because
they
were
pleasing
unto
the
carnal
mind
and
Itaught
them
even
until
I
had
much
success
insomuch
that
Iverily
believed
that
they
were
true
and
for
this
cause
Iwithstood
the
truth
even
until
I
have
brought
this
great
curseupon
mealma


now
when
he
had
said
this
he
besought
that
alma
should
prayunto
god
that
the
curse
might
be
taken
from
himalma


but
alma
said
unto
him
If
this
curse
should
be
taken
fromthee
thou
wouldst
again
lead
away
the
hearts
of
this
peopletherefore
it
shall
be
unto
thee
even
as
the
lord
willalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
curse
was
not
taken
off
ofkorihor
but
he
was
cast
out
and
went
about
from
house
to
housebegging
for
his
foodalma


now
the
knowledge
of
what
had
happened
unto
korihor
wasimmediately
published
throughout
all
the
land
yea
theproclamation
was
sent
forth
by
the
chief
judge
to
all
the
peoplein
the
land
declaring
unto
those
who
had
believed
in
the
wordsof
korihor
that
they
must
speedily
repent
lest
the
samejudgments
would
come
unto
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
all
convinced
of
thewickedness
of
korihor
therefore
they
were
all
converted
againunto
the
lord
and
this
put
an
end
to
the
iniquity
after
themanner
of
korihor

and
korihor
did
go
about
from
house
to
housebegging
food
for
his
supportalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
he
went
forth
among
the
peopleyea
among
a
people
who
had
separated
themselves
from
thenephites
and
called
themselves
zoramites
being
led
by
a
manwhose
name
was
zoramand
as
he
went
forth
amongst
them
beholdhe
was
run
upon
and
trodden
down
even
until
he
was
deadalma


and
thus
we
see
the
end
of
him
who
perverteth
the
ways
of
thelord
and
thus
we
see
that
the
devil
will
not
support
hischildren
at
the
last
day
but
doth
speedily
drag
them
down
tohellalma
chapter
alma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
end
of
korihor
alma
havingreceived
tidings
that
the
zoramites
were
perverting
the
ways
ofthe
lord
and
that
zoram
who
was
their
leader
was
leading
thehearts
of
the
people
to
bow
down
to
dumb
idols
his
heart
againbegan
to
sicken
because
of
the
iniquity
of
the
peoplealma


for
it
was
the
cause
of
great
sorrow
to
alma
to
know
ofiniquity
among
his
people
therefore
his
heart
was
exceedinglysorrowful
because
of
the
separation
of
the
zoramites
from
thenephitesalma


now
the
zoramites
had
gathered
themselves
together
in
a
landwhich
they
called
antionum
which
was
east
of
the
land
ofzarahemla
which
lay
nearly
bordering
upon
the
seashore
whichwas
south
of
the
land
of
jershon
which
also
bordered
upon
thewilderness
south
which
wilderness
was
full
of
the
lamanitesalma


now
the
nephites
greatly
feared
that
the
zoramites
would
enterinto
a
correspondence
with
the
lamanites
and
that
it
would
bethe
means
of
great
loss
on
the
part
of
the
nephitesalma


and
now
as
the
preaching
of
the
word
had
a
great
tendency
tolead
the
people
to
do
that
which
was
justyea
it
had
had
morepowerful
effect
upon
the
minds
of
the
people
than
the
sword
oranything
else
which
had
happened
unto
themtherefore
almathought
it
was
expedient
that
they
should
try
the
virtue
of
theword
of
godalma


therefore
he
took
ammon
and
aaron
and
omner
and
himni
hedid
leave
in
the
church
in
zarahemla
but
the
former
three
hetook
with
him
and
also
amulek
and
zeezrom
who
were
at
melekand
he
also
took
two
of
his
sonsalma


now
the
eldest
of
his
sons
he
took
not
with
him
and
his
namewas
helaman
but
the
names
of
those
whom
he
took
with
him
wereshiblon
and
corianton
and
these
are
the
names
of
those
who
wentwith
him
among
the
zoramites
to
preach
unto
them
the
wordalma


now
the
zoramites
were
dissenters
from
the
nephites
thereforethey
had
had
the
word
of
god
preached
unto
themalma


but
they
had
fallen
into
great
errors
for
they
would
notobserve
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
his
statutesaccording
to
the
law
of
mosesalma


neither
would
they
observe
the
performances
of
the
church
tocontinue
in
prayer
and
supplication
to
god
daily
that
they
mightnot
enter
into
temptationalma


yea
in
fine
they
did
pervert
the
ways
of
the
lord
in
verymany
instances
therefore
for
this
cause
alma
and
his
brethrenwent
into
the
land
to
preach
the
word
unto
themalma


now
when
they
had
come
into
the
land
behold
to
theirastonishment
they
found
that
the
zoramites
had
built
synagoguesand
that
they
did
gather
themselves
together
on
one
day
of
theweek
which
day
they
did
call
the
day
of
the
lord
and
they
didworship
after
a
manner
which
alma
and
his
brethren
had
neverbeheldalma


for
they
had
a
place
built
up
in
the
center
of
theirsynagogue
a
place
for
standing
which
was
high
above
the
headand
the
top
thereof
would
only
admit
one
personalma


therefore
whosoever
desired
to
worship
must
go
forth
andstand
upon
the
top
thereof
and
stretch
forth
his
hands
towardsheaven
and
cry
with
a
loud
voice
sayingalma


holy
holy
god
we
believe
that
thou
art
god
and
we
believethat
thou
art
holy
and
that
thou
wast
a
spirit
and
that
thouart
a
spirit
and
that
thou
wilt
be
a
spirit
foreveralma


holy
god
we
believe
that
thou
hast
separated
us
from
ourbrethren
and
we
do
not
believe
in
the
tradition
of
our
brethrenwhich
was
handed
down
to
them
by
the
childishness
of
theirfathers
but
we
believe
that
thou
hast
elected
us
to
be
thy
holychildren
and
also
thou
hast
made
it
known
unto
us
that
thereshall
be
no
christalma


but
thou
art
the
same
yesterday
today
and
forever
and
thouhast
elected
us
that
we
shall
be
saved
whilst
all
around
us
areelected
to
be
cast
by
thy
wrath
down
to
hell
for
the
whichholiness
o
god
we
thank
thee
and
we
also
thank
thee
that
thouhast
elected
us
that
we
may
not
be
led
away
after
the
foolishtraditions
of
our
brethren
which
doth
bind
them
down
to
a
beliefof
christ
which
doth
lead
their
hearts
to
wander
far
from
theeour
godalma


and
again
we
thank
thee
o
god
that
we
are
a
chosen
and
aholy
people

amenalma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
alma
and
his
brethren
and
hissons
had
heard
these
prayers
they
were
astonished
beyond
allmeasurealma


for
behold
every
man
did
go
forth
and
offer
up
these
sameprayersalma


now
the
place
was
called
by
them
rameumptom
which
beinginterpreted
is
the
holy
standalma


now
from
this
stand
they
did
offer
up
every
man
theselfsame
prayer
unto
god
thanking
their
god
that
they
werechosen
of
him
and
that
he
did
not
lead
them
away
after
thetradition
of
their
brethren
and
that
their
hearts
were
notstolen
away
to
believe
in
things
to
come
which
they
knew
nothingaboutalma


now
after
the
people
had
all
offered
up
thanks
after
thismanner
they
returned
to
their
homes
never
speaking
of
their
godagain
until
they
had
assembled
themselves
together
again
to
theholy
stand
to
offer
up
thanks
after
their
manneralma


now
when
alma
saw
this
his
heart
was
grieved
for
he
saw
thatthey
were
a
wicked
and
a
perverse
people
yea
he
saw
that
theirhearts
were
set
upon
gold
and
upon
silver
and
upon
all
mannerof
fine
goodsalma


yea
and
he
also
saw
that
their
hearts
were
lifted
up
untogreat
boasting
in
their
pridealma


and
he
lifted
up
his
voice
to
heaven
and
cried
saying
ohow

thou
suffer
that

now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
alma
had
said
these
words
thathe
clapped
his
hands
upon
all
them
who
were
with
him

andbehold
as
he
clapped
his
hands
upon
them
they
were
filled
withthe
holy
spiritalma


and
after
that
they
did
separate
themselves
one
from
anothertaking
no
thought
for
themselves
what
they
should
eat
or
whatthey
should
drink
or
what
they
should
put
onalma


and
the
lord
provided
for
them
that
they
should
hunger
notneither
should
they
thirst
yea
and
he
also
gave
them
strengththat
they
should
suffer
no
manner
of
afflictions
save
it
wereswallowed
up
in
the
joy
of
christ

now
this
was
according
to
theprayer
of
alma
and
this
because
he
prayed
in
faithalma
chapter
alma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
go
forth
and
began
topreach
the
word
of
god
unto
the
people
entering
into
theirsynagogues
and
into
their
houses
yea
and
even
they
did
preachthe
word
in
their
streetsalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
much
labor
among
them
theybegan
to
have
success
among
the
poor
class
of
people
for
beholdthey
were
cast
out
of
the
synagogues
because
of
the
coarseness
oftheir
apparelalma


therefore
they
were
not
permitted
to
enter
into
theirsynagogues
to
worship
god
being
esteemed
as
filthinesstherefore
they
were
poor
yea
they
were
esteemed
by
theirbrethren
as
dross
therefore
they
were
poor
as
to
things
of
theworld
and
also
they
were
poor
in
heartalma


now
as
alma
was
teaching
and
speaking
unto
the
people
uponthe
hill
onidah
there
came
a
great
multitude
unto
him
who
werethose
of
whom
we
have
been
speaking
of
whom
were
poor
in
heartbecause
of
their
poverty
as
to
the
things
of
the
worldalma


and
they
came
unto
alma
and
the
one
who
was
the
foremostamong
them
said
unto
him
behold
what
shall
these
my
brethrendo
for
they
are
despised
of
all
men
because
of
their
povertyyea
and
more
especially
by
our
priests
for
they
have
cast
usout
of
our
synagogues
which
we
have
labored
abundantly
to
buildwith
our
own
hands
and
they
have
cast
us
out
because
of
ourexceeding
poverty
and
we
have
no
place
to
worship
our
god
andbehold
what
shall
we
doalma


and
now
when
alma
heard
this
he
turned
him
about
his
faceimmediately
towards
him
and
he
beheld
with
great
joy
for
hebeheld
that
their
afflictions
had
truly
humbled
them
and
thatthey
were
in
a
preparation
to
hear
the
wordalma


therefore
he
did
say
no
more
to
the
other
multitude
but
hestretched
forth
his
hand
and
cried
unto
those
whom
he
beheldwho
were
truly
penitent
and
said
unto
themalma


I
behold
that
ye
are
lowly
in
heart
and
if
so
blessed
areyealma


behold
thy
brother
hath
said
what
shall
we
dofor
we
arecast
out
of
our
synagogues
that
we
cannot
worship
our
godalma


behold
I
say
unto
you
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
cannot
worshipgod
save
it
be
in
your
synagogues
onlyalma


moreover
I
would
ask
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
must
not
worshipgod
only
once
in
a
weekalma


I
say
unto
you
it
is
well
that
ye
are
cast
out
of
yoursynagogues
that
ye
may
be
humble
and
that
ye
may
learn
wisdomfor
it
is
necessary
that
ye
should
learn
wisdom
for
it
isbecause
that
ye
are
cast
out
that
ye
are
despised
of
yourbrethren
because
of
your
exceeding
poverty
that
ye
are
broughtto
a
lowliness
of
heart
for
ye
are
necessarily
brought
to
behumblealma


and
now
because
ye
are
compelled
to
be
humble
blessed
areye
for
a
man
sometimes
if
he
is
compelled
to
be
humble
seekethrepentance
and
now
surely
whosoever
repenteth
shall
find
mercyand
he
that
findeth
mercy
and
endureth
to
the
end
the
same
shallbe
savedalma


and
now
as
I
said
unto
you
that
because
ye
were
compelledto
be
humble
ye
were
blessed
do
ye
not
suppose
that
they
aremore
blessed
who
truly
humble
themselves
because
of
the
wordalma


yea
he
that
truly
humbleth
himself
and
repenteth
of
hissins
and
endureth
to
the
end
the
same
shall
be
blessedyeamuch
more
blessed
than
they
who
are
compelled
to
be
humblebecause
of
their
exceeding
povertyalma


therefore
blessed
are
they
who
humble
themselves
withoutbeing
compelled
to
be
humble
or
rather
in
other
words
blessedis
he
that
believeth
in
the
word
of
god
and
is
baptized
withoutstubbornness
of
heart
yea
without
being
brought
to
know
theword
or
even
compelled
to
know
before
they
will
believealma


yea
there
are
many
who
do
say
If
thou
wilt
show
unto
us
asign
from
heaven
then
we
shall
know
of
a
surety
then
we
shallbelievealma


now
I
ask
is
this
faith

behold
I
say
unto
you
nay
forif
a
man
knoweth
a
thing
he
hath
no
cause
to
believe
for
heknoweth
italma


and
now
how
much
more
cursed
is
he
that
knoweth
the
will
ofgod
and
doeth
it
not
than
he
that
only
believeth
or
only
hathcause
to
believe
and
falleth
into
transgressionalma


now
of
this
thing
ye
must
judge

behold
I
say
unto
youthat
it
is
on
the
one
hand
even
as
it
is
on
the
other
and
itshall
be
unto
every
man
according
to
his
workalma


and
now
as
I
said
concerning
faithfaith
is
not
to
have
aperfect
knowledge
of
things
therefore
if
ye
have
faith
ye
hopefor
things
which
are
not
seen
which
are
truealma


and
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
and
I
would
that
ye
shouldremember
that
god
is
merciful
unto
all
who
believe
on
his
nametherefore
he
desireth
in
the
first
place
that
ye
shouldbelieve
yea
even
on
his
wordalma


and
now
he
imparteth
his
word
by
angels
unto
men
yea
notonly
men
but
women
also

now
this
is
not
all
little
children
dohave
words
given
unto
them
many
times
which
confound
the
wise
andthe
learnedalma


and
now
my
beloved
brethren
as
ye
have
desired
to
know
ofme
what
ye
shall
do
because
ye
are
afflicted
and
cast
outnow
Ido
not
desire
that
ye
should
suppose
that
I
mean
to
judge
youonly
according
to
that
which
is
truealma


for
I
do
not
mean
that
ye
all
of
you
have
been
compelled
tohumble
yourselves
for
I
verily
believe
that
there
are
some
amongyou
who
would
humble
themselves
let
them
be
in
whatsoevercircumstances
they
mightalma


now
as
I
said
concerning
faiththat
it
was
not
a
perfectknowledgeeven
so
it
is
with
my
words

ye
cannot
know
of
theirsurety
at
first
unto
perfection
any
more
than
faith
is
aperfect
knowledgealma


but
behold
if
ye
will
awake
and
arouse
your
faculties
evento
an
experiment
upon
my
words
and
exercise
a
particle
of
faithyea
even
if
ye
can
no
more
than
desire
to
believe
let
thisdesire
work
in
you
even
until
ye
believe
in
a
manner
that
ye
cangive
place
for
a
portion
of
my
wordsalma


now
we
will
compare
the
word
unto
a
seed

now
if
ye
giveplace
that
a
seed
may
be
planted
in
your
heart
behold
if
it
bea
true
seed
or
a
good
seed
if
ye
do
not
cast
it
out
by
yourunbelief
that
ye
will
resist
the
spirit
of
the
lord
behold
itwill
begin
to
swell
within
your
breasts
and
when
you
feel
theseswelling
motions
ye
will
begin
to
say
within
yourselvesIt
mustneeds
be
that
this
is
a
good
seed
or
that
the
word
is
good
forit
beginneth
to
enlarge
my
soul
yea
it
beginneth
to
enlightenmy
understanding
yea
it
beginneth
to
be
delicious
to
mealma


now
behold
would
not
this
increase
your
faith

I
say
untoyou
yea
nevertheless
it
hath
not
grown
up
to
a
perfectknowledgealma


but
behold
as
the
seed
swelleth
and
sprouteth
andbeginneth
to
grow
then
you
must
needs
say
that
the
seed
is
goodfor
behold
it
swelleth
and
sprouteth
and
beginneth
to
grow
and
now
behold
will
not
this
strengthen
your
faith

yea
itwill
strengthen
your
faith
for
ye
will
say
I
know
that
this
is
agood
seed
for
behold
it
sprouteth
and
beginneth
to
growalma


and
now
behold
are
ye
sure
that
this
is
a
good
seed

I
sayunto
you
yea
for
every
seed
bringeth
forth
unto
its
ownlikenessalma


therefore
if
a
seed
groweth
it
is
good
but
if
it
growethnot
behold
it
is
not
good
therefore
it
is
cast
awayalma


and
now
behold
because
ye
have
tried
the
experiment
andplanted
the
seed
and
it
swelleth
and
sprouteth
and
beginneth
togrow
ye
must
needs
know
that
the
seed
is
goodalma


and
now
behold
is
your
knowledge
perfect

yea
yourknowledge
is
perfect
in
that
thing
and
your
faith
is
dormantand
this
because
ye
know
for
ye
know
that
the
word
hath
swelledyour
souls
and
ye
also
know
that
it
hath
sprouted
up
that
yourunderstanding
doth
begin
to
be
enlightened
and
your
mind
dothbegin
to
expandalma


o
then
is
not
this
real

I
say
unto
you
yea
because
it
islight
and
whatsoever
is
light
is
good
because
it
isdiscernible
therefore
ye
must
know
that
it
is
good
and
nowbehold
after
ye
have
tasted
this
light
is
your
knowledgeperfectalma


behold
I
say
unto
you
nay
neither
must
ye
lay
aside
yourfaith
for
ye
have
only
exercised
your
faith
to
plant
the
seedthat
ye
might
try
the
experiment
to
know
if
the
seed
was
goodalma


and
behold
as
the
tree
beginneth
to
grow
ye
will
say
letus
nourish
it
with
great
care
that
it
may
get
root
that
it
maygrow
up
and
bring
forth
fruit
unto
us

and
now
behold
if
yenourish
it
with
much
care

now
after

spoken
these

they

desiring
to
know

alma

unto

behold
ye
have
said
that
ye
couldnot
worship
your
god

ye
are
cast
out
of
your
synagogues
but
behold
I
say
unto
you
if
ye
suppose
that
ye
cannot
worshipgod
ye
do
greatly
err
and
ye
ought
to
search
the
scriptures
ifye
suppose
that
they

do
ye
remember
to
have
read
what
zenos
the
prophet
of

said
concerning
prayer
or

for
he
said
thou
art
merciful
o

for
thou
hast
heard
myprayer
even
when
I
was
in
the
wilderness
yea
thou
wastmerciful
when
I
prayed
concerning
those
who
were
mine
enemiesand
thou
didst
turn
them
to
mealma


yea
o
god
and
thou
wast
merciful
unto
me
when
I
did
cry
untothee
in
my
field
when
I
did
cry
unto
thee
in
my
prayer

thoudidst

and
again
o
god
when
I
did
turn
to
my
house
thou
didst
hearme
in
my
prayeralma


and
when
I
did
turn
unto
my
closet
o
lord
and
prayed
untothee
thou
didst
hear
mealma


yea
thou
art
merciful
unto
thy
children
when
they
cry
untothee
to
be
heard
of
thee
and
not
of
men
and
thou
wilt
hearthemalma


yea
o
god
thou
hast
been
merciful
unto
me
and
heard
mycries
in
the
midst
of
thy
congregationsalma


yea
and
thou
hast
also
heard
me
when
I
have
been
cast
outand
have
been
despised
by
mine
enemies
yea
thou
didst
hear
mycries
and
wast
angry
with
mine
enemies
and
thou
didst
visitthem
in
thine
anger
with
speedy
destructionalma


and
thou
didst
hear
me
because
of
mine
afflictions
and
mysincerity
and
it
is
because
of
thy
son
that
thou
hast
been
thusmerciful
unto
me
therefore
I
will
cry
unto
thee
in
all
mineafflictions
for
in
thee
is
my
joy
for
thou
hast
turned
thyjudgments
away
from
me
because
of
thy
sonalma


and
now
alma
said
unto
them
do
ye
believe
those
scriptureswhich
have
been
written
by
them
of
oldalma


behold
if
ye
do
ye
must
believe
what
zenos
said
forbehold
he
said
thou
hast
turned
away
thy
judgments
because
ofthy
sonalma


now
behold
my
brethren
I
would
ask
if
ye
have
read
thescriptures

If
ye
have
how
can
ye
disbelieve
on
the
son
of
godalma


for
it
is
not
written
that
zenos
alone
spake
of
these
thingsbut
zenock
also
spake
of
these
thingsalma


for
behold
he
said
thou
art
angry
o
lord
with
thispeople
because
they
will
not
understand
thy
mercies
which
thouhast
bestowed
upon
them
because
of
thy
sonalma


and
now
my
brethren
ye
see
that
a
second
prophet
of
old
hastestified
of
the
son
of
god
and
because
the
people
would
notunderstand
his
words
they
stoned
him
to
deathalma


but
behold
this
is
not
all
these
are
not
the
only
ones
whohave
spoken
concerning
the
son
of
godalma


behold
he
was
spoken
of
by
moses
yea
and
behold
a
type
wasraised
up
in
the
wilderness
that
whosoever
would
look
upon
itmight
live

and
many
did
look
and
livealma


but
few
understood
the
meaning
of
those
things
and
thisbecause
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts

but
there
were
many
whowere
so
hardened
that
they
would
not
look
therefore
theyperished

now
the
reason
they
would
not
look
is
because
they
didnot
believe
that
it
would
heal
themalma


o
my
brethren
if
ye
could
be
healed
by
merely
casting
aboutyour
eyes
that
ye
might
be
healed
would
ye
not
behold
quicklyor
would
ye
rather
harden
your
hearts
in
unbelief
and
beslothful
that
ye
would
not
cast
about
your
eyes
that
ye
mightperishalma


If
so
wo
shall
come
upon
you
but
if
not
so
then
cast
aboutyour
eyes
and
begin
to
believe
in
the
son
of
god
that
he
willcome
to
redeem
his
people
and
that
he
shall
suffer
and
die
toatone
for
their
sins
and
that
he
shall
rise
again
from
the
deadwhich
shall
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
that
all
men
shallstand
before
him
to
be
judged
at
the
last
and
judgment
dayaccording
to
their
worksalma


and
now
my
brethren
I
desire
that
ye
shall
plant
this
wordin
your
hearts
and
as
it
beginneth
to
swell
even
so
nourish
itby
your
faith

and
behold
it
will
become
a
tree
springing
upin
you
unto
everlasting
life

and
then
may
god
grant
unto
youthat
your
burdens
may
be
light
through
the
joy
of
his

all
this

chapter
alma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
alma
had
spoken
these
wordsunto
them
he
sat
down
upon
the
ground
and
amulek
arose
and
beganto
teach
them
sayingalma


my
brethren
I
think
that
it
is
impossible
that
ye
should
beignorant
of
the
things
which
have
been
spoken
concerning
thecoming
of
christ
who
is
taught
by
us
to
be
the
son
of
god
yeaI
know
that
these
things
were
taught
unto
you
bountifully
beforeyour
dissension
from
among
usalma


and
as
ye
have
desired
of
my
beloved
brother
that
he
shouldmake
known
unto
you
what
ye
should
do
because
of
yourafflictions
and
he
hath
spoken
somewhat
unto
you
to
prepare
yourminds
yea
and
he
hath
exhorted
you
unto
faith
and
to
patiencealma


yea
even
that
ye
would
have
so
much
faith
as
even
to
plantthe
word
in
your
hearts
that
ye
may
try
the
experiment
of
itsgoodnessalma


and
we
have
beheld
that
the
great
question
which
is
in
yourminds
is
whether
the
word
be
in
the
son
of
god
or
whether
thereshall
be
no
christalma


and
ye
also
beheld
that
my
brother
has
proved
unto
you
inmany
instances
that
the
word
is
in
christ
unto
salvationalma


my
brother
has
called
upon
the
words
of
zenos
that
redemptioncometh
through
the
son
of
god
and
also
upon
the
words
of
zenockand
also
he
has
appealed
unto
moses
to
prove
that
these
thingsare
truealma


and
now
behold
I
will
testify
unto
you
of
myself
that
thesethings
are
true

behold
I
say
unto
you
that
I
do
know
thatchrist
shall
come
among
the
children
of
men
to
take
upon
him
thetransgressions
of
his
people
and
that
he
shall
atone
for
thesins
of
the
world
for
the
lord
god
hath
spoken
italma


for
it
is
expedient
that
an
atonement
should
be
made
foraccording
to
the
great
plan
of
the
eternal
god
there
must
be
anatonement
made
or
else
all
mankind
must
unavoidably
perish
yeaall
are
hardened
yea
all
are
fallen
and
are
lost
and
mustperish
except
it
be
through
the
atonement
which
it
is
expedientshould
be
madealma


for
it
is
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
great
and
lastsacrifice
yea
not
a
sacrifice
of
man
neither
of
beast
neitherof
any
manner
of
fowl
for
it
shall
not
be
a
human
sacrifice
butit
must
be
an
infinite
and
eternal
sacrificealma


now
there
is
not
any
man
that
can
sacrifice
his
own
bloodwhich
will
atone
for
the
sins
of
another

now
if
a
manmurdereth
behold
will
our
law
which
is
just
take
the
life
ofhis
brother

I
say
unto
you
nayalma


but
the
law
requireth
the
life
of
him
who
hath
murderedtherefore
there
can
be
nothing
which
is
short
of
an
infiniteatonement
which
will
suffice
for
the
sins
of
the
worldalma


therefore
it
is
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
great
andlast
sacrifice
and
then
shall
there
be
or
it
is
expedient
thereshould
be
a
stop
to
the
shedding
of
blood
then
shall
the
law
ofmoses
be
fulfilled
yea
it
shall
be
all
fulfilled
every
jot
andtittle
and
none
shall
have
passed
awayalma


and
behold
this
is
the
whole
meaning
of
the
law
every
whitpointing
to
that
great
and
last
sacrifice
and
that
great
andlast
sacrifice
will
be
the
son
of
god
yea
infinite
and
eternalalma


and
thus
he
shall
bring
salvation
to
all
those
who
shallbelieve
on
his
name
this
being
the
intent
of
this
lastsacrifice
to
bring
about
the
bowels
of
mercy
which
overpowerethjustice
and
bringeth
about
means
unto
men
that
they
may
havefaith
unto
repentancealma


and
thus
mercy
can
satisfy
the
demands
of
justice
andencircles
them
in
the
arms
of
safety
while
he
that
exercises
nofaith
unto
repentance
is
exposed
to
the
whole

justice
therefore
only
unto
him
that
has
faith

therefore
may
god
grant
unto
you
my
brethren
that
ye
maybegin
to
exercise
your
faith
unto
repentance
that
ye
begin
tocall
upon
his
holy
name
that
he
would
have
mercy
upon

yea
cry
unto
him
for
mercy
for
he
is
mighty
to
savealma


yea
humble
yourselves
and
continue
in
prayer
unto
himalma


cry
unto
him
when
ye

over

cry
unto

houses

over
all
your

morning
midday

yea
cry
unto
him
against
the
power
of
your

yea
cry
unto

against
the
devil
who
is
an
enemy
to
allrighteousnessalma


cry
unto
him
over
the
crops
of
your
fields
that
ye
mayprosper
in
themalma


cry
over
the
flocks
of
your
fields
that
they
may
increasealma


but
this
is
not
all
ye
must
pour
out
your
souls
in
yourclosets
and
your
secret
places
and
in
your
wildernessalma


yea
and
when
you
do
not
cry
unto
the
lord
let
your
heartsbe
full
drawn
out
in
prayer
unto
him
continually
for
yourwelfare
and
also
for
the
welfare
of
those
who
are
around
youalma


and
now
behold
my
beloved
brethren
I
say
unto
you
do
notsuppose
that
this
is
all
for
after
ye
have
done
all
thesethings
if
ye
turn
away
the
needy
and
the
naked
and
visit
notthe
sick
and
afflicted
and
impart
of
your
substance
if
ye
haveto
those
who
stand
in
needI
say
unto
you
if
ye
do
not
any
ofthese
things
behold
your
prayer
is
vain
and
availeth
younothing
and
ye
are
as
hypocrites
who
do
deny
the
faithalma


therefore
if
ye
do
not
remember
to
be
charitable
ye
are
asdross
which
the
refiners
do
cast
out
it
being
of
no
worth
andis
trodden
under
foot
of
menalma


and
now
my
brethren
I
would
that
after
ye
have
received
somany
witnesses
seeing
that
the
holy
scriptures
testify
of
thesethings
ye
come
forth
and
bring
fruit
unto
repentancealma


yea
I
would
that
ye
would
come
forth
and
harden
not
yourhearts
any
longer
for
behold
now
is
the
time
and
the
day
ofyour
salvation
and
therefore
if
ye
will
repent
and
harden
notyour
hearts
immediately
shall
the
great
plan
of
redemption
bebrought
about
unto
youalma


for
behold
this
life
is
the
time
for
men
to
prepare
to
meetgod
yea
behold
the
day
of
this
life
is
the
day
for
men
toperform
their
laborsalma


and
now
as
I
said
unto
you
before
as
ye
have
had
so
manywitnesses
therefore
I
beseech
of
you
that
ye
do
notprocrastinate
the
day
of
your
repentance
until
the
end
for
afterthis
day
of
life
which
is
given
us
to
prepare
for
eternitybehold
if
we
do
not
improve
our
time
while
in
this
life
thencometh
the
night
of
darkness
wherein
there
can
be
no
laborperformedalma


ye
cannot
say
when
ye
are
brought
to
that
awful
crisis
thatI
will
repent
that
I
will
return
to
my
god

nay
ye
cannot
saythis
for
that
same
spirit
which
doth
possess
your
bodies
at
thetime
that
ye
go
out
of
this
life
that
same
spirit
will
havepower
to
possess
your
body
in
that
eternal
worldalma


for
behold
if
ye
have
procrastinated
the
day
of
yourrepentance
even
until
death
behold
ye
have
become
subjected
tothe
spirit
of
the
devil
and
he
doth
seal
you
his
therefore
thespirit
of
the
lord
hath
withdrawn
from
you
and
hath
no
place
inyou
and
the
devil
hath
all
power
over
you
and
this
is
the
finalstate
of
the
wickedalma


and
this
I
know
because
the
lord
hath
said
he
dwelleth
notin
unholy
temples
but
in
the
hearts
of
the
righteous
doth
hedwell
yea
and
he
has
also
said
that
the
righteous
shall
sitdown
in
his
kingdom
to
go
no
more
out
but
their
garments
shouldbe
made
white
through
the
blood
of
the
lambalma


and
now
my
beloved
brethren
I
desire
that
ye
shouldremember
these
things
and
that
ye
should
work
out
your
salvationwith
fear
before
god
and
that
ye
should
no
more
deny
the
comingof
christalma


that
ye
contend
no
more
against
the
holy
ghost
but
that
yereceive
it
and
take
upon
you
the
name
of
christ
that
ye
humbleyourselves
even
to
the
dust
and
worship
god
in
whatsoever
placeye
may
be
in
in
spirit
and
in
truth
and
that
ye
live
inthanksgiving
daily
for
the
many
mercies
and
blessings
which
hedoth
bestow
upon
youalma


yea
and
I
also
exhort
you
my
brethren
that
ye
be
watchfulunto
prayer
continually
that
ye
may
not
be
led
away
by
thetemptations
of
the
devil
that
he
may
not
overpower
you
that
yemay
not
become
his
subjects
at
the
last
day
for
behold
herewardeth
you
no
good
thingalma


and
now
my
beloved
brethren
I
would
exhort
you
to
havepatience
and
that
ye
bear
with
all
manner
of
afflictions
thatye
do
not
revile
against
those
who
do
cast
you
out
because
ofyour
exceeding
poverty
lest
ye
become
sinners
like
unto
themalma


but
that
ye
have
patience
and
bear
with
those
afflictionswith
a
firm
hope
that
ye
shall
one
day
rest
from
all
yourafflictionsalma

of
thezoramites
had
consulted
together
concerning
the
words
which
hadbeen
preached
unto
them
they
were
angry
because
of
the
word
forit
did
destroy
their
craft
therefore
they
would
not
hearken
untothe
wordsalma


and
they
sent
and
gathered
together
throughout
all
the
landall
the
people
and
consulted
with
them
concerning
the
wordswhich
had
been
spokenalma


now
their
rulers
and
their
priests
and
their
teachers
did
notlet
the
people
know
concerning
their
desires
therefore
theyfound
out
privily
the
minds
of
all
the
peoplealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
found
out
the
minds
ofall
the
people
those
who
were
in
favor
of
the
words
which
hadbeen
spoken
by
alma
and
his
brethren
were
cast
out
of
the
landand
they
were
many
and
they
came
over
also
into
the
land
ofjershonalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
alma
and
his
brethren
did
ministerunto
themalma


now
the
people
of
the
zoramites
were
angry
with
the
people
ofammon
who
were
in
jershon
and
the
chief
ruler
of
the
zoramitesbeing
a
very
wicked
man
sent
over
unto
the
people
of
ammondesiring
them
that
they
should
cast
out
of
their
land
all
thosewho
came
over
from
them
into
their
landalma


and
he
breathed
out
many
threatenings
against
them

and
nowthe
people
of
ammon
did
not
fear
their
words
therefore
they
didnot
cast
them
out
but
they
did
receive
all
the
poor
of
thezoramites
that
came
over
unto
them
and
they
did
nourish
themand
did
clothe
them
and
did
give
unto
them
lands
for
theirinheritance
and
they
did
administer
unto
them
according
to
theirwantsalma


now
this
did
stir
up
the
zoramites
to
anger
against
thepeople
of
ammon
and
they
began
to
mix
with
the
lamanites
and
tostir
them
up
also
to
anger
against
themalma


and
thus
the
zoramites
and
the
lamanites
began
to
makepreparations
for
war
against
the
people
of
ammon
and
alsoagainst
the
nephitesalma


and
thus
ended
the
seventeenth
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudges
over
the
people
of
nephialma


and
the
people
of
ammon
departed
out
of
the
land
of
jershonand
came
over
into
the
land
of
melek
and
gave
place
in
the
landof
jershon
for
the
armies
of
the
nephites
that
they
mightcontend
with
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
and
the
armies
of
thezoramites
and
thus
commenced
a
war
betwixt
the
lamanites
and
thenephites
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
andan
account
shall
be
given
of
their
wars
hereafteralma


and
alma
and
ammon
and
their
brethren
and
also
the
twosons
of
alma
returned
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
after
having
beeninstruments
in
the
hands
of
god
of
bringing
many
of
the
zoramitesto
repentance
and
as
many
as
were
brought
to
repentance
weredriven
out
of
their
land
but
they
have
lands
for
theirinheritance
in
the
land
of
jershon
and
they
have
taken
up
armsto
defend
themselves
and
their
wives
and
children
and
theirlandsalma


now
alma
being
grieved
for
the
iniquity
of
his
people
yeafor
the
wars
and
the
bloodsheds
and
the
contentions
which
wereamong
them
and
having
been
to
declare
the
word
or
sent
todeclare
the
word
among
all
the
people
in
every
city
and
seeingthat
the
hearts
of
the
people
began
to
wax
hard
and
that
theybegan
to
be
offended
because
of
the
strictness
of
the
word
hisheart
was
exceedingly
sorrowfulalma


therefore
he
caused
that
his
sons
should
be
gatheredtogether
that
he
might
give
unto
them
every
one
his
chargeseparately
concerning
the
things
pertaining
unto
righteousness
and
we
have
an
account
of
his
commandments
which
he
gave
untothem
according
to
his
own
recordalma
chapter
alma


my
son
give
ear
to
my
words
for
I
swear
unto
you
thatinasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
god
ye
shallprosper
in
the
landalma


I
would
that
ye
should
do
as
I
have
done
in
remembering
thecaptivity
of
our
fathers
for
they
were
in
bondage
and
nonecould
deliver
them
except
it
was
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
godof
Isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
and
he
surely
did
deliver
them
intheir
afflictionsalma


and
now
o
my
son
helaman
behold
thou
art
in
thy
youth
andtherefore
I
beseech
of
thee
that
thou
wilt
hear
my
words
andlearn
of
me
for
I
do
know
that
whosoever
shall
put
their
trustin
god
shall
be
supported
in
their
trials
and
their
troublesand
their
afflictions
and
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
dayalma


and
I
would
not
that
ye
think
that
I
know
of
myselfnot
ofthe
temporal
but
of
the
spiritual
not
of
the
carnal
mind
but
ofgodalma


now
behold
I
say
unto
you
if
I
had
not
been
born
of
god
Ishould
not
have
known
these
things
but
god
has
by
the
mouth
ofhis
holy
angel
made
these
things
known
unto
me
not
of
anyworthiness
of
myselfalma


for
I
went
about
with
the
sons
of
mosiah
seeking
to
destroythe
church
of
god
but
behold
god
sent
his
holy
angel
to
stop
usby
the
wayalma


and
behold
he
spake
unto
us
as
it
were
the
voice
of
thunderand
the
whole
earth
did
tremble
beneath
our
feet
and
we
all
fellto
the
earth
for
the
fear
of
the
lord
came
upon
usalma


but
behold
the
voice
said
unto
me
arise

and
I
arose
andstood
up
and
beheld
the
angelalma


and
he
said
unto
me
If
thou
wilt
of
thyself
be
destroyedseek
no
more
to
destroy
the
church
of
godalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
fell
to
the
earth
and
it
was
forthe
space
of
three
days
and
three
nights
that
I
could
not
open
mymouth
neither
had
I
the
use
of
my
limbsalma


and
the
angel
spake
more
things
unto
me
which
were
heard
bymy
brethren
but
I
did
not
hear
them
for
when
I
heard
thewordsIf
thou
wilt
be
destroyed
of
thyself
seek
no
more
todestroy
the
church
of
godI
was
struck
with
such
great
fear
andamazement
lest
perhaps
I
should
be
destroyed
that
I
fell
to
theearth
and
I
did
hear
no
morealma


but
I
was
racked
with
eternal
torment
for
my
soul
washarrowed
up
to
the
greatest
degree
and
racked
with
all
my
sinsalma


yea
I
did
remember
all
my
sins
and
iniquities
for
which
Iwas
tormented
with
the
pains
of
hell
yea
I
saw
that
I
hadrebelled
against
my
god
and
that
I
had
not
kept
his
holycommandmentsalma


yea
and
I
had
murdered
many
of
his
children
or
rather
ledthem
away
unto
destruction
yea
and
in
fine
so
great
had
been
myiniquities
that
the
very
thought
of
coming
into
the
presence
ofmy
god
did
rack
my
soul
with
inexpressible
horroralma


oh
thought
I
that
I
could
be
banished
and
become
extinctboth
soul
and
body
that
I
might
not
be
brought
to
stand
in
thepresence
of
my
god
to
be
judged
of
my
deedsalma


and
now
for
three
days
and
for
three
nights
was
I
rackedeven
with
the
pains
of
a
damned
soulalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
I
was
thus
racked
with
tormentwhile
I
was
harrowed
up
by
the
memory
of
my
many
sins
behold
Iremembered
also
to
have
heard
my
father
prophesy
unto
the
peopleconcerning
the
coming
of
one
jesus
christ
a
son
of
god
to
atonefor
the
sins
of
the
worldalma


now
as
my
mind
caught
hold
upon
this
thought
I
cried
withinmy
heart
o
jesus
thou
son
of
god
have
mercy
on
me
who
am
inthe
gall
of
bitterness
and
am
encircled
about
by
the
everlastingchains
of
deathalma


and
now
behold
when
I
thought
this
I
could
remember
mypains
no
more
yea
I
was
harrowed
up
by
the
memory
of
my
sins
nomorealma


and
oh
what
joy
and
what
marvelous
light
I
did
behold
yeamy
soul
was
filled
with
joy
as
exceeding
as
was
my
painalma


yea
I
say
unto
you
my
son
that
there
could
be
nothing
soexquisite
and
so
bitter
as
were
my
pains

yea
and
again
I
sayunto
you
my
son
that
on
the
other
hand
there
can
be
nothing
soexquisite
and
sweet
as
was
my
joyalma


yea
methought
I
saw
even
as
our
father
lehi
saw
godsitting
upon
his
throne
surrounded
with
numberless
concourses
ofangels
in
the
attitude
of
singing
and
praising
their
god
yeaand
my
soul
did
long
to
be
therealma


but
behold
my
limbs
did
receive
their
strength
again
and
Istood
upon
my
feet
and
did
manifest
unto
the
people
that
I
hadbeen
born
of
godalma


yea
and
from
that
time
even
until
now
I
have
laboredwithout
ceasing
that
I
might
bring
souls
unto
repentance
that
Imight
bring
them
to
taste
of
the
exceeding
joy
of
which
I
didtaste
that
they
might
also
be
born
of
god
and
be
filled
withthe
holy
ghostalma


yea
and
now
behold
o
my
son
the
lord
doth
give
meexceedingly
great
joy
in
the
fruit
of
my
laborsalma


for
because
of
the
word
which
he
has
imparted
unto
mebehold
many
have
been
born
of
god
and
have
tasted
as
I
havetasted
and
have
seen
eye
to

as
I
have
seen
therefore
theydo
know
of
these
things
of
which
I
have
spoken
as
I
do
know
andthe
knowledge
which
I
have
is
of

and
I
have
been
supported
under
trials
and
troubles
of
everykind

and
in
all
manner
of
afflictions

god
hasdelivered
me
from
prison
and
from
bonds
and
from
death

I
do
put
my
trust
in
him

he
will
still
deliver

and
I
know
that
he
will
raise
me
up
at
the
last
day
to
dwellwith
him
in
glory

and
I
will
praise
him
forever
for
he
hasbrought
our
fathers
out

and
he
has
swallowed
up
theegyptians
in
the
red
sea
and
he
led
them

and
he

helaman
I
command
you
that
ye
take
therecords
which

and
I
also
command
you
that
ye
keep
a
record
of
this
peopleaccording
as
I
have
done
upon
the
plates
of
nephi
and
keep
allthese
things
sacred
which
I
have
kept
even
as
I
have
kept
themfor
it
is
for
a
wise
purpose
that
they
are

and
these
plates
of
brass
which
contain
these
engravingswhich
have
the
records
of
the
holy
scriptures
upon
them
whichhave
the
genealogy
of
our
forefathers
even
from

beginningalma


behold
it
has
been
prophesied
by
our
fathers
that
theyshould
be
kept
and
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
anotherand
be
kept
and
preserved
by
the
hand
of
the

and
they
will
retain

andalso
shall
all
the

now
ye
may
suppose
that
this
is
foolishness
in
me
but
beholdI
say
unto
you
that
by
small
and
simple
things
are
great
thingsbrought
to
pass
and
small
means
in
many
instances
doth
confoundthe
wisealma


and
the
lord
god
doth
work
by
means
to
bring
about
his
greatand
eternal
purposes
and
by
very
small
means
the
lord
dothconfound
the
wise
and
bringeth
about
the
salvation
of
many
soulsalma


and
now
it
has
hitherto
been
wisdom
in
god
that
these
thingsshould
be
preserved
for
behold
they
have
enlarged
the
memory
ofthis
people
yea
and
convinced
many
of
the
error
of
their
waysand
brought
them
to
the
knowledge
of
their
god
unto
the
salvationof
their
soulsalma


yea
I
say
unto
you
were
it
not
for
these
things
that
theserecords
do
contain
which
are
on
these
plates
ammon
and
hisbrethren
could
not
have
convinced
so
many
thousands
of
thelamanites
of
the
incorrect
tradition
of
their
fathers
yea
theserecords
and
their
words
brought
them
unto
repentance
that
isthey
brought
them
to
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
their
god
and
torejoice
in
jesus
christ
their
redeemeralma


and
who
knoweth
but
what
they
will
be
the
means
of
bringingmany
thousands
of
them
yea
and
also
many
thousands
of
ourstiffnecked
brethren
the
nephites
who
are
now
hardening
theirhearts
in
sin
and
iniquities
to
the
knowledge
of
their
redeemeralma


now
these
mysteries
are
not
yet
fully
made
known
unto
metherefore
I
shall
forbearalma


and
it
may
suffice
if
I
only
say
they
are
preserved
for
awise
purpose
which
purpose
is
known
unto
god
for
he
dothcounsel
in
wisdom
over
all
his
works
and
his
paths
are
straightand
his
course
is
one
eternal
roundalma


o
remember

my
son
helaman
how
strict
are
thecommandments

and
he
said
If

landbut
if
ye
keep
not
hiscommandments
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from

and
now
remember
my
son
that
god
has
entrusted
you
withthese
things
which
are
sacred
which
he
has
kept

which
he
will

he
may
show

and
now
behold
I
tell
you
by
the
spirit
of
prophecy
that
ifye

the
commandments
of

behold
these
things
whichare

that
which
the

no
power
of

can
take
them
from
you

powerful
to
thefulfilling
of
all
his
wordsalma


for
he
will
fulfil

his
promises
which
he
shall
make
untoyou
for
he
has
fulfilled
his
promises
which
he
has
made

for
he
promised
unto
them
that
he
would
preserve
these
thingsfor
a
wise
purpose
in
him
that
he
might
show
forth
his
powerunto
future
generationsalma


and
now
behold
one
purpose
hath
he
fulfilled
even
to
therestoration
of
many
thousands
of
the
lamanites
to
the
knowledgeof
the
truth
and
he
hath
shown
forth
his
power
in
them
and
hewill
also
still
show
forth
his
power
in
them
unto
futuregenerations
therefore
they
shall
be
preservedalma


therefore
I
command

my
son
helaman
that
ye
be
diligentin
fulfilling
all
my
words
and
that
ye

and
now
I
will
speak
unto

not
repent
they
should
be
destroyedfrom
off

and
the
lord
said
I
will
prepare
unto
my
servant
gazelem
astone
which

shine
forth
in

unto

that
I
maydiscover
unto

that
I
may
discover
untothem
the
works
of
their
brethren
yea
their
secret
works
theirworks
of
darkness
and
their
wickedness
and
abominationsalma


and
now
my
son
these
interpreters
were
prepared
that
theword
of
god
might
be
fulfilled
which
he
spake
sayingalma


I
will
bring
forth
out
of
darkness
unto
light
all
theirsecret
works
and
their
abominations
and
except
they
repent
Iwill
destroy
them
from

and
I
willbring

all
their
secrets

hereafter
possess

and
now
my
son
we
see
that
they
did
not
repent

have
been
destroyed
and
thus
far
the
word
of
god
has
beenfulfilled
yea
their
secret
abominations
have
been
brought
outof
darkness
and
made
known
unto

and
now
my

I
command
you
that
ye
retain
all
theiroaths
and
their
covenants
and
their
agreements
in
their
secretabominations
yea
and
all
their
signs
and
their
wonders

shallkeep
from
this
people
that
they
know
them
not
lest
peradventurethey
should
fall
into

behold
there
is
a
curse
upon

shall
come
upon
all
those

to
the
power
of

I
desire
that

might
not
be

therefore
ye

and
their
abominations
shall
ye
make
known
untothem
and
ye
shall
teach
them
to
abhor
such
wickedness
andabominations
and
murders
and
ye
shall
also
teach
them
that
thesepeople
were
destroyed
on
account
of
their
wickedness
andabominations
and
their
murdersalma


for
behold
they
murdered
all
the
prophets
of
the
lord
whocame
among
them
to
declare
unto
them
concerning
their
iniquitiesand
the
blood
of
those
whom
they
murdered
did
cry
unto
the
lordtheir
god
for
vengeance
upon
those
who
were
their
murderers

the

and
now
my

remember
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
untoyou

those
secret
plans
unto
this
people
but

iniquityalma

faith

and
now
my
son
I
have
somewhat
to
say
concerning
the
thingwhich
our
fathers
call
a
ball
or
directoror
our
fathers
calledit
liahona
which
is
being
interpreted
a
compass
and
the
lordprepared
italma


and
behold
there
cannot
any
man
work
after
the
manner
of
socurious
a
workmanship

and
behold
it
was
prepared
to
show
untoour
fathers
the
course
which
they
should
travel
in
thewildernessalma


and
it
did
work
for
them
according
to
their
faith
in
godtherefore
if
they
had
faith
to
believe
that
god
could
cause
thatthose
spindles
should
point
the
way
they
should
go
behold
itwas
done
therefore
they
had
this
miracle
and
also
many
othermiracles
wrought
by
the
power
of
god
day
by
dayalma


nevertheless
because
those
miracles
were
worked
by
smallmeans
it
did
show
unto
them
marvelous
works

they
were
slothfuland
forgot
to
exercise
their
faith
and
diligence
and
then
thosemarvelous
works
ceased
and
they
did
not
progress
in
theirjourneyalma


therefore
they
tarried
in
the
wilderness
or
did
not
travela
direct
course
and
were
afflicted
with
hunger
and
thirstbecause
of
their
transgressionsalma


and
now
my
son
I
would
that
ye
should
understand
that
thesethings
are
not
without
a
shadow
for
as
our
fathers
were
slothfulto
give
heed
to
this
compass
now
these
things
were
temporalthey
did
not
prosper
even
so
it
is
with
things
which
arespiritualalma


for
behold
it
is
as
easy
to
give
heed
to
the
word
of
christwhich
will
point
to
you
a
straight
course
to
eternal
bliss
as
itwas
for
our
fathers
to
give
heed
to
this
compass
which
wouldpoint
unto
them
a
straight
course
to
the
promised
landalma


and
now
I
say
is
there
not
a
type
in
this
thing

for
justas
surely
as
this
director
did
bring
our
fathers
by
followingits
course
to
the
promised
land
shall
the
words
of
christ
ifwe
follow
their
course
carry
us
beyond
this
vale
of
sorrow
intoa
far
better
land
of
promisealma


o
my
son
do
not
let
us
be
slothful
because
of
the
easinessof
the
way
for
so
was
it
with
our
fathers
for
so
was
itprepared
for
them
that
if
they
would
look
they
might
live
evenso
it
is
with
us

the
way
is
prepared
and
if
we
will
look
wemay
live
foreveralma


and
now
my
son
see
that
ye
take
care
of
these
sacredthings
yea
see
that
ye
look
to
god
and
live

go
unto
thispeople

declare
the
word

now
my

I
would
not
that
ye
should
think
that
I
knowthese
things
of
myself
but
it
is
the
spirit
of
god
which
is
inme
which
maketh
these
things
known
unto
me
for
if
I
had
not
beenborn
of

I
should
not
have
known
these
thingsalma


but
behold
the
lord
in
his
great
mercy
sent
his
angel
todeclare
unto
me
that
I
must
stop
the
work
of
destruction

I

never

for
thou
didst
not
give
so
much
heed

my
words
as
did
thybrother

what
Ihave
against

this

not
all
my

which

Isabelalma


yea
she
did
steal
away

this

noexcuse

thou
shouldst
have
tended
to
theministry
wherewith

wast
entrustedalma


know
ye
not
my
son
that
these
things
are
an
abomination
inthe
sight
of
the
lord

most
abominable
above
all
sins
saveit
be
the
shedding
of
innocent
blood

denying

ye
deny
the
holy
ghost

will
stand

would
that

how
great
iniquity
yebrought
upon

zoramites
for
when
they
saw
your
conduct

and
now
the

lord
doth
say

thychildren
to
do
good
lest
they
lead
away
the
hearts

that
ye
refrain

your
iniquitiesalma


that
ye
turn

all
your
mind

ye
lead
away
the
hearts
of
no
more
to
do
wickedlybut
rather
return
unto
them
and
acknowledge
your
faults
and
thatwrong
which
ye
have
donealma


seek
not
after
riches
nor
the
vain
things
of
this
world

you
cannot
carry
them
with

and
now
my
son
I
would
say
somewhat
unto
you
concerning
thecoming
of
christ

behold
I
say
unto
you
that
it
is
he
thatsurely
shall
come
to
take
away
the
sins
of

to
declare
glad
tidings

was
the
ministry
unto

ye
werecalled

declare
these
glad
tidings
unto

may
prepare
the
minds

now
I
will
ease
your
mind
somewhat
on
this
subject

you
marvel
why
these
things
should
be
known
so
longbeforehand

I
say
unto
you

not
a
soul

this
timeas
precious
unto
god
as
a

Is
it
not
as
necessary
that
the
plan
of
redemption
should
bemade
known
unto
this
people
as
well
as
unto
their
childrenalma


Is
it
not

chapter
alma


now
my
son
here
is
somewhat
more
I
would
say
unto
thee
for
Iperceive
that
thy
mind
is
worried
concerning
the
resurrection
ofthe
deadalma


behold
I
say
unto
you
that
there
is
no
resurrectionor
Iwould
say
in
other
words
that
this
mortal
does
not
put
onimmortality
this
corruption
does
not
put
on
incorruptionuntilafter
the
coming
of
christalma


behold
he
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead

butbehold
my
son
the
resurrection
is
not
yet

now
I
unfold
untoyou
a
mystery
nevertheless
there
are
many
mysteries
which
arekept
that
no
one
knoweth
them
save
god
himself

but
I
show
untoyou
one
thing
which
I
have
inquired
diligently
of
god
that
Imight
knowthat
is
concerning
the
resurrectionalma


behold
there
is
a
time
appointed
that
all
shall
come
forthfrom
the
dead

now
when
this
time
cometh
no
one
knows
but
godknoweth
the
time
which
is
appointedalma


now
whether
there
shall
be
one
time
or
a
second
time
or
athird
time
that
men
shall
come
forth
from
the
dead
it
matterethnot
for
god
knoweth
all
these
things
and
it
sufficeth
me
toknow
that
this
is
the
casethat
there
is
a
time
appointed
thatall
shall
rise
from
the
deadalma


now
there
must
needs
be
a
space
betwixt
the
time
of
death
andthe
time
of
the
resurrectionalma


and
now
I
would
inquire
what
becometh
of
the
souls
of
men
fromthis
time
of
death
to
the
time
appointed
for
the
resurrectionalma


now
whether
there
is
more
than
one
time
appointed
for
men
torise
it
mattereth
not
for
all
do
not
die
at
once
and
thismattereth
not
all
is
as
one
day
with
god
and
time
only
ismeasured
unto
menalma


therefore
there
is
a
time
appointed
unto
men
that
they
shallrise
from
the
dead
and
there
is
a
space
between
the
time
ofdeath
and
the
resurrection

and
now
concerning
this
space
oftime
what
becometh
of
the
souls
of
men
is
the
thing
which
I
haveinquired
diligently
of
the
lord
to
know
and
this
is
the
thing
ofwhich
I
do
knowalma


and
when
the
time
cometh
when
all
shall
rise
then
shall
theyknow
that
god
knoweth
all
the
times
which
are
appointed
unto
manalma


now
concerning
the
state
of
the
soul
between
death
and
theresurrectionbehold
it
has
been
made
known
unto
me
by
an
angelthat
the
spirits
of
all
men
as
soon
as
they
are
departed
fromthis
mortal
body
yea
the
spirits
of
all
men
whether
they
begood
or
evil
are
taken
home
to
that
god
who
gave
them
lifealma


and
then
shall
it
come
to
pass
that
the
spirits
of
those
whoare
righteous
are
received
into
a
state
of
happiness
which
iscalled
paradise
a
state
of
rest
a
state
of
peace
where
theyshall
rest
from
all
their
troubles
and
from
all
care
and
sorrowalma


and
then
shall
it
come
to
pass
that
the
spirits
of
thewicked
yea
who
are
evilfor
behold
they
have
no
part
norportion
of
the
spirit
of
the
lord
for
behold
they
chose
evilworks
rather
than
good
therefore
the
spirit
of
the
devil
didenter
into
them
and
take
possession
of
their
houseand
theseshall
be
cast
out
into
outer
darkness
there
shall
be
weepingand
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
and
this
because
of
their
owniniquity
being
led
captive
by
the
will
of
the
devilalma


now
this
is
the
state
of
the
souls
of
the
wicked
yea
indarkness
and
a
state
of
awful
fearful
looking
for
the
fieryindignation
of
the
wrath
of
god
upon
them
thus
they
remain
inthis
state
as
well
as
the
righteous
in
paradise
until
the
timeof
their
resurrectionalma


now
there
are
some
that
have
understood
that
this
state
ofhappiness
and
this
state
of
misery
of
the
soul
before
theresurrection
was
a
first
resurrection

yea
I
admit
it
may
betermed
a
resurrection
the
raising
of
the
spirit
or
the
soul
andtheir
consignation
to
happiness
or
misery
according
to
the
wordswhich
have
been
spokenalma


and
behold
again
it
hath
been
spoken
that
there
is
a
firstresurrection
a
resurrection
of
all
those
who
have
been
or
whoare
or
who
shall
be
down
to
the
resurrection
of
christ
from
thedeadalma


now
we
do
not
suppose
that
this
first
resurrection
which
isspoken
of
in
this
manner
can
be
the
resurrection
of
the
soulsand
their
consignation
to
happiness
or
misery

ye
cannot
supposethat
this
is
what
it
meanethalma


behold
I
say
unto
you
nay
but
it
meaneth
the
reuniting
ofthe
soul
with
the
body
of
those
from
the
days
of
adam
down
tothe
resurrection
of
christalma


now
whether
the
souls
and
the
bodies
of
those
of
whom
hasbeen
spoken
shall
all
be
reunited
at
once
the
wicked
as
well
asthe
righteous
I
do
not
say
let
it
suffice
that
I
say
that
theyall
come
forth
or
in
other
words
their
resurrection
cometh
topass
before
the
resurrection
of
those
who
die
after
theresurrection
of
christalma


now
my
son
I
do
not
say
that
their
resurrection
cometh
atthe
resurrection
of
christ
but
behold
I
give
it
as
my
opinionthat
the
souls
and
the
bodies
are
reunited
of
the
righteous
atthe
resurrection
of
christ
and
his
ascension
into
heavenalma


but
whether
it
be
at
his
resurrection
or
after
I
do
not
saybut
this
much
I
say
that
there
is
a
space
between
death
and
theresurrection
of
the
body
and
a
state
of
the
soul
in
happiness
orin
misery
until
the
time
which
is
appointed
of
god
that
the
deadshall
come
forth
and
be
reunited
both
soul
and
body
and
bebrought
to
stand
before
god
and
be
judged
according
to
theirworksalma


yea
this
bringeth
about
the
restoration
of
those
things
ofwhich
has
been
spoken
by
the
mouths
of
the
prophetsalma


the
soul
shall
be
restored
to
the
body
and
the
body
to
thesoul
yea
and
every
limb
and
joint
shall
be
restored
to
itsbody
yea
even
a
hair
of
the
head
shall
not
be
lost
but
allthings
shall
be
restored
to
their
proper
and
perfect
framealma


and
now
my
son
this
is
the
restoration
of
which
has
beenspoken
by
the
mouths
of
the
prophetsalma


and
then
shall
the
righteous
shine
forth
in
the
kingdom
ofgodalma


but
behold
an
awful
death
cometh
upon
the
wicked
for
theydie
as
to
things
pertaining
to
things
of
righteousness
for
theyare
unclean
and
no
unclean
thing
can
inherit
the
kingdom
of
godbut
they
are
cast
out
and
consigned
to
partake
of
the
fruits
oftheir
labors
or
their
works
which
have
been
evil
and
they
drinkthe
dregs
of
a
bitter
cupalma
chapter
alma


and
now
my
son
I
have
somewhat
to
say
concerning
therestoration
of
which
has
been
spoken
for
behold
some
havewrested
the
scriptures
and
have
gone
far
astray
because
of
thisthing

and
I
perceive
that
thy
mind
has
been
worried
alsoconcerning
this
thing

but
behold
I
will
explain
it
unto
theealma


I
say
unto
thee
my
son
that
the
plan
of
restoration
isrequisite
with
the
justice
of
god
for
it
is
requisite
that
allthings
should
be
restored
to
their
proper
order

behold
it
isrequisite
and
just
according
to
the
power
and
resurrection
ofchrist
that
the
soul
of
man
should
be
restored
to
its
body
andthat
every
part
of
the
body
should
be
restored
to
itselfalma


and
it
is
requisite
with
the
justice
of
god
that
men
should
bejudged
according
to
their
works
and
if
their
works
were
good
inthis
life
and
the
desires
of
their
hearts
were
good
that
theyshould
also
at
the
last
day
be
restored
unto
that
which
isgoodalma


and
if
their
works
are
evil
they
shall
be
restored
unto
themfor
evil

therefore
all
things
shall
be
restored
to
theirproper
order
every
thing
to
its
natural
framemortality
raisedto
immortality
corruption
to
incorruptionraised
to
endlesshappiness
to
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
or
to
endless
misery

the
kingdom
of
the
devil

one

one
hand

otheron

the
one
raised
to
happiness
according
to
his
desires
ofhappiness
or
good
according
to
his
desires
of
good
and
theother
to
evil
according
to
his
desires
of
evil
for
as
he
hasdesired
to
do
evil
all
the
day
long
even
so
shall
he
have
hisreward
of
evil
when
the
night
comethalma


and
so
it
is
on
the
other
hand

If
he
hath
repented
of
hissins
and
desired
righteousness
until
the
end
of
his
days
evenso
he
shall
be
rewarded
unto
righteousnessalma


these
are
they
that
are
redeemed
of
the
lord
yea
these
arethey
that
are
taken
out
that
are
delivered
from
that
endlessnight
of
darkness
and
thus
they
stand
or
fall
for
behold
theyare
their
own
judges
whether
to
do
good
or
do
evilalma


now
the
decrees
of
god
are
unalterable
therefore
the
way
isprepared
that
whosoever
will
may
walk
therein
and
be
savedalma


and
now
behold
my
son
do
not
risk
one
more
offense
againstyour
god
upon
those
points
of
doctrine
which
ye
have
hithertorisked
to
commit
sinalma


do
not
suppose
because
it
has
been
spoken
concerningrestoration
that
ye
shall
be
restored
from
sin
to
happiness
behold
I
say
unto
you
wickedness
never
was
happinessalma


and
now
my
son
all
men
that
are
in
a
state
of
nature
or
Iwould
say
in
a
carnal
state
are
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
andin
the
bonds
of
iniquity
they
are
without
god
in
the
world
andthey
have
gone
contrary
to
the
nature
of
god
therefore
they
arein
a
state
contrary
to
the
nature
of
happinessalma


and
now
behold
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
restoration
totake
a
thing
of
a
natural
state
and
place
it
in
an
unnaturalstate
or
to
place
it
in
a
state
opposite
to
its
naturealma


o
my
son
this
is
not
the
case
but
the
meaning
of
the
wordrestoration
is
to
bring
back
again
evil
for
evil
or
carnal
forcarnal
or
devilish
for
devilishgood
for
that
which
is
goodrighteous
for
that
which
is
righteous
just
for
that
which
isjust
merciful
for
that
which
is
mercifulalma


therefore
my
son
see
that
you
are
merciful
unto
yourbrethren
deal
justly
judge
righteously
and
do
goodcontinually
and
if
ye
do
all
these
things
then
shall
ye
receiveyour
reward
yea
ye
shall
have
mercy
restored
unto
you
again
yeshall
have
justice
restored
unto
you
again
ye
shall
have
arighteous
judgment
restored
unto
you
again
and
ye
shall
havegood
rewarded
unto
you
againalma


for
that
which
ye
do
send
out
shall
return
unto
you
againand
be
restored
therefore
the
word
restoration
more
fullycondemneth
the
sinner
and
justifieth
him
not
at
allalma
chapter
alma


and
now
my
son
I
perceive
there
is
somewhat
more
which
dothworry
your
mind
which
ye
cannot
understandwhich
is
concerningthe
justice
of
god
in
the
punishment
of
the
sinner
for
ye
do
tryto
suppose
that
it
is
injustice
that
the
sinner
should
beconsigned
to
a
state
of
miseryalma


now
behold
my
son
I
will
explain
this
thing
unto
thee

forbehold
after
the
lord
god
sent
our
first
parents
forth
from
thegarden
of
eden
to
till
the
ground
from
whence
they
weretakenyea
he
drew
out
the
man
and
he
placed
at
the
east
end
ofthe
garden
of
eden
cherubim
and
a
flaming
sword
which
turnedevery
way
to
keep
the
tree
of
lifealma


now
we
see
that
the
man
had
become
as
god
knowing
good
andevil
and
lest
he
should
put
forth
his
hand
and
take
also
of
thetree
of
life
and
eat
and
live
forever
the
lord
god
placedcherubim
and
the
flaming
sword
that
he
should
not
partake
of
thefruitalma


and
thus
we
see
that
there
was
a
time
granted
unto
man
torepent
yea
a
probationary
time
a
time
to
repent
and
serve
godalma


for
behold
if
adam
had
put
forth
his
hand
immediately
andpartaken
of
the
tree
of
life
he
would
have
lived
foreveraccording
to
the
word
of
god
having
no
space
for
repentanceyea
and
also
the
word
of
god
would
have
been
void
and
the
greatplan
of
salvation
would
have
been
frustratedalma


but
behold
it
was
appointed
unto
man
to
dietherefore
asthey
were
cut
off
from
the
tree
of
life
they
should
be
cut
offfrom
the
face
of
the
earthand
man
became
lost
forever
yeathey
became
fallen
manalma


and
now
ye
see
by
this
that
our
first
parents
were
cut
offboth
temporally
and
spiritually
from
the
presence
of
the
lordand
thus
we
see
they
became
subjects
to
follow
after
their
ownwillalma


now
behold
it
was
not
expedient
that
man
should
be
reclaimedfrom
this
temporal
death
for
that
would
destroy
the
great
planof
happinessalma


therefore
as
the
soul
could
never
die
and
the
fall
hadbrought
upon
all
mankind
a
spiritual
death
as
well
as
a
temporalthat
is
they
were
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
it
wasexpedient
that
mankind
should
be
reclaimed
from
this
spiritualdeathalma


therefore
as
they
had
become
carnal
sensual
and
devilishby
nature
this
probationary
state
became
a
state
for
them
toprepare
it
became
a
preparatory
statealma


and
now
remember
my
son
if
it
were
not
for
the
plan
ofredemption
laying
it
aside
as
soon
as
they
were
dead
theirsouls
were
miserable
being
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
thelordalma


and
now
there
was
no
means
to
reclaim
men
from
this
fallenstate
which
man
had
brought
upon
himself
because
of
his
owndisobediencealma


therefore
according
to
justice
the
plan
of
redemption
couldnot
be
brought
about
only
on
conditions
of
repentance
of
men
inthis
probationary
state
yea
this
preparatory
state
for
exceptit
were
for
these
conditions
mercy
could
not
take
effect
exceptit
should
destroy
the
work
of
justice

now
the
work
of
justicecould
not
be
destroyed
if
so
god
would
cease
to
be
godalma


and
thus
we
see
that
all
mankind
were
fallen
and
they
werein
the
grasp
of
justice
yea
the
justice
of
god
which
consignedthem
forever
to
be
cut
off
from
his
presencealma


and
now
the
plan
of
mercy
could
not
be
brought
about
exceptan
atonement
should
be
made
therefore
god
himself
atoneth
forthe
sins
of
the
world
to
bring
about
the
plan
of
mercy
toappease
the
demands
of
justice
that
god
might
be
a
perfect
justgod
and
a
merciful
god
alsoalma


now
repentance
could
not
come
unto
men
except
there
were
apunishment
which
also
was
eternal
as
the
life
of
the
soul
shouldbe
affixed
opposite
to
the
plan
of
happiness
which
was
aseternal
also
as
the
life
of
the
soulalma


now
how
could
a
man
repent
except
he
should
sin

how
couldhe
sin
if
there
was
no
law

how
could
there
be
a
law
save
therewas
a
punishmentalma


now
there
was
a
punishment
affixed
and
a
just
law
givenwhich
brought
remorse
of
conscience
unto
manalma


now
if
there
was
no
law
givenif
a
man
murdered
he
shoulddiewould
he
be
afraid
he
would
die
if
he
should
murderalma


and
also
if
there
was
no
law
given
against
sin
men
would
notbe
afraid
to
sinalma


and
if
there
was
no
law
given
if
men
sinned
what
couldjustice
do
or
mercy
either
for
they
would
have
no
claim
uponthe
creaturealma


but
there
is
a
law
given
and
a
punishment
affixed
and
arepentance
granted
which
repentance
mercy
claimeth
otherwisejustice
claimeth
the
creature
and
executeth
the
law
and
the
lawinflicteth
the
punishment
if
not
so
the
works
of
justice
wouldbe
destroyed
and
god
would
cease
to
be
godalma


but
god
ceaseth
not
to
be
god
and
mercy
claimeth
thepenitent
and
mercy
cometh
because
of
the
atonement
and
theatonement
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
theresurrection
of
the
dead
bringeth
back
men
into
the
presence
ofgod
and
thus
they
are
restored
into
his
presence
to
be
judgedaccording
to
their
works
according
to
the
law
and
justicealma


for
behold
justice
exerciseth
all
his
demands
and
alsomercy
claimeth
all
which
is
her
own
and
thus
none
but
the
trulypenitent
are
savedalma


what
do
ye
suppose
that
mercy
can
rob
justice

I
say
untoyou
nay
not
one
whit

If
so
god
would
cease
to
be
godalma


and
thus
god
bringeth
about
his
great
and
eternal
purposeswhich
were
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world

and
thuscometh
about
the
salvation
and
the
redemption
of
men
and
alsotheir
destruction
and
miseryalma


therefore
o
my
son
whosoever
will
come
may
come
and
partakeof
the
waters
of
life
freely
and
whosoever
will
not
come
thesame
is
not
compelled
to
come
but
in
the
last
day
it
shall
berestored
unto
him
according
to
his
deedsalma


If
he
has
desired
to
do
evil
and
has
not
repented
in
hisdays
behold
evil
shall
be
done
unto
him
according
to
therestoration
of
godalma


and
now
my
son
I
desire
that
ye
should
let
these
thingstrouble
you
no
more
and
only
let
your
sins
trouble
you
withthat
trouble
which
shall
bring
you
down
unto
repentancealma


o
my
son
I
desire
that
ye
should
deny
the
justice
of
god
nomore

do
not
endeavor
to
excuse
yourself
in
the
least
pointbecause
of
your
sins
by
denying
the
justice
of
god
but
do
youlet
the
justice
of
god
and
his
mercy
and
his
longsufferinghave
full
sway
in
your
heart
and
let
it
bring
you
down
to
thedust
in
humilityalma


and
now
o
my
son
ye
are
called
of
god
to
preach
the
wordunto
this
people

and
now
my
son
go
thy
way
declare
the
wordwith
truth
and
soberness
that
thou
mayest

chapter
alma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
sons
of
alma
did
go
forthamong
the
people
to
declare
the
word
unto
them

and
alma
alsohimself
could
not
rest
and
he
also
went
forthalma


now
we
shall
say
no
more
concerning
their
preaching
exceptthat
they
preached
the
word
and
the
truth
according
to
thespirit
of
prophecy
and
revelation
and
they
preached
after
theholy
order
of
god
by
which
they
were
calledalma


and
now
I
return
to
an
account
of
the
wars
between
thenephites
and
the
lamanites
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
the
reignof
the
judgesalma


for
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
zoramites
becamelamanites
therefore
in
the
commencement
of
the
eighteenth
yearthe
people
of
the
nephites
saw
that
the
lamanites
were
comingupon
them
therefore
they
made
preparations
for
war
yea
theygathered
together
their
armies
in
the
land
of
jershonalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
came
with
theirthousands
and
they
came
into
the
land
of
antionum
which
is
theland
of
the
zoramites
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
zerahemnah
wastheir
leaderalma


and
now
as
the
amalekites
were
of
a
more
wicked
and
murderousdisposition
than
the
lamanites
were
in
and
of
themselvestherefore
zerahemnah
appointed
chief
captains
over
thelamanites
and
they
were
all
amalekites
and
zoramitesalma


now
this
he
did
that
he
might
preserve
their
hatred
towardsthe
nephites
that
he
might
bring
them
into
subjection
to
theaccomplishment
of
his
designsalma


for
behold
his
designs
were
to
stir
up
the
lamanites
to
angeragainst
the
nephites
this
he
did
that
he
might
usurp
great
powerover
them
and
also
that
he
might
gain
power
over
the
nephites
bybringing
them
into
bondagealma


and
now
the
design
of
the
nephites
was
to
support
their
landsand
their
houses
and
their
wives
and
their
children
that
theymight
preserve
them
from
the
hands
of
their
enemies
and
alsothat
they
might
preserve
their
rights
and
their
privileges
yeaand
also
their
liberty
that
they
might
worship
god
according
totheir
desiresalma


for
they
knew
that
if
they
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
thelamanites
that
whosoever
should
worship
god
in
spirit
and
intruth
the
true
and
the
living
god
the
lamanites
would
destroyalma


yea
and
they
also
knew
the
extreme
hatred
of
the
lamanitestowards
their
brethren
who
were
the
people
of
antinephilehiwho
were
called
the
people
of
ammonand
they
would
not
take
uparms
yea
they
had
entered
into
a
covenant
and
they
would
notbreak
ittherefore
if
they
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
thelamanites
they
would
be
destroyedalma


and
the
nephites
would
not
suffer
that
they
should
bedestroyed
therefore
they
gave
them
lands
for
their
inheritancealma


and
the
people
of
ammon
did
give
unto
the
nephites
a
largeportion
of
their
substance
to
support
their
armies
and
thus
thenephites
were
compelled
alone
to
withstand
against
thelamanites
who
were
a
compound
of
laman
and
lemuel
and
the
sonsof
Ishmael
and
all
those
who
had
dissented
from
the
nephiteswho
were
amalekites
and
zoramites
and
the
descendants
of
thepriests
of
noahalma


now
those
descendants
were
as
numerous
nearly
as
were
thenephites
and
thus
the
nephites
were
obliged
to
contend
withtheir
brethren
even
unto
bloodshedalma


and
it
came
to
pass
as
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
hadgathered
together
in
the
land
of
antionum
behold
the
armies
ofthe
nephites
were
prepared
to
meet
them
in
the
land
of
jershonalma


now
the
leader
of
the
nephites
or
the
man
who
had
beenappointed
to
be
the
chief
captain
over
the
nephitesnow
thechief
captain
took
the
command
of
all
the
armies
of
thenephitesand
his
name
was
moronialma


and
moroni
took
all
the
command
and
the
government
of
theirwars

and
he
was
only
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
wasappointed
chief
captain
over
the
armies
of
the
nephitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
met
the
lamanites
in
the
bordersof
jershon
and
his
people
were
armed
with
swords
and
withcimeters
and
all
manner
of
weapons
of
waralma


and
when
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
saw
that
the
people
ofnephi
or
that
moroni
had
prepared
his
people
with
breastplatesand
with
armshields
yea
and
also
shields
to
defend
theirheads
and
also
they
were
dressed
with
thick
clothingalma


now
the
army
of
zerahemnah
was
not
prepared
with
any
suchthing
they
had
only
their
swords
and
their
cimeters
their
bowsand
their
arrows
their
stones
and
their
slings
and
they
werenaked
save
it
were
a
skin
which
was
girded
about
their
loinsyea
all
were
naked
save
it
were
the
zoramites
and
theamalekitesalma


but
they
were
not
armed
with
breastplates
norshieldstherefore
they
were
exceedingly
afraid
of
the
armies
ofthe
nephites
because
of
their
armor
notwithstanding
their
numberbeing
so
much
greater
than
the
nephitesalma


behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
they
durst
not
come
againstthe
nephites
in
the
borders
of
jershon
therefore
they
departedout
of
the
land
of
antionum
into
the
wilderness
and
took
theirjourney
round
about
in
the
wilderness
away
by
the
head
of
theriver
sidon
that
they
might
come
into
the
land
of
manti
and
takepossession
of
the
land
for
they
did
not
suppose
that
the
armiesof
moroni
would
know
whither
they
had
gonealma


but
it
came
to
pass
as
soon
as
they
had
departed
into
thewilderness
moroni
sent
spies
into
the
wilderness
to
watch
theircamp
and
moroni
also
knowing
of
the
prophecies
of
alma
sentcertain
men
unto
him
desiring
him
that
he
should
inquire
of
thelord
whither
the
armies
of
the
nephites
should
go
to
defendthemselves
against
the
lamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
word
of
the
lord
came
unto
almaand
alma
informed
the
messengers
of
moroni
that
the
armies
ofthe
lamanites
were
marching
round
about
in
the
wilderness
thatthey
might
come
over
into
the
land
of
manti
that
they
mightcommence
an
attack
upon
the
weaker
part
of
the
people

and
thosemessengers
went
and
delivered
the
message
unto
moronialma


now
moroni
leaving
a
part
of
his
army
in
the
land
ofjershon
lest
by
any
means
a
part
of
the
lamanites
should
comeinto
that
land
and
take
possession
of
the
city
took
theremaining
part
of
his
army
and
marched
over
into
the
land
ofmantialma


and
he
caused
that
all
the
people
in
that
quarter
of
the
landshould
gather
themselves
together
to
battle
against
thelamanites
to
defend
their
lands
and
their
country
their
rightsand
their
liberties
therefore
they
were
prepared
against
thetime
of
the
coming
of
the
lamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
caused
that
his
army
shouldbe
secreted
in
the
valley
which
was
near
the
bank
of
the
riversidon
which
was
on
the
west
of
the
river
sidon
in
thewildernessalma


and
moroni
placed
spies
round
about
that
he
might
know
whenthe
camp
of
the
lamanites
should
comealma


and
now
as
moroni
knew
the
intention
of
the
lamanites
thatit
was
their
intention
to
destroy
their
brethren
or
to
subjectthem
and
bring
them
into
bondage
that
they
might
establish
akingdom
unto
themselves
over
all
the
landalma


and
he
also
knowing
that
it
was
the
only
desire
of
thenephites
to
preserve
their
lands
and
their
liberty
and
theirchurch
therefore
he
thought
it
no
sin
that
he
should
defend
themby
stratagem
therefore
he
found
by
his
spies
which
course
thelamanites
were
to
takealma


therefore
he
divided
his
army
and
brought
a
part
over
intothe
valley
and
concealed
them
on
the
east
and
on
the
south
ofthe
hill
riplahalma


and
the
remainder
he
concealed
in
the
west
valley
on
thewest
of
the
river
sidon
and
so
down
into
the
borders
of
the
landmantialma


and
thus
having
placed
his
army
according
to
his
desire
hewas
prepared
to
meet
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
came
up
on
the
northof
the
hill
where
a
part
of
the
army
of
moroni
was
concealedalma


and
as
the
lamanites
had
passed
the
hill
riplah
and
cameinto
the
valley
and
began
to
cross
the
river
sidon
the
armywhich
was
concealed
on
the
south
of
the
hill
which
was
led
by
aman
whose
name
was
lehi
and
he
led
his
army
forth
and
encircledthe
lamanites
about
on
the
east
in
their
rearalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
when
they
saw
thenephites
coming
upon
them
in
their
rear
turned
them
about
andbegan
to
contend
with
the
army
of
lehialma


and
the
work
of
death
commenced
on
both
sides
but
it
wasmore
dreadful
on
the
part
of
the
lamanites
for
their
nakednesswas
exposed
to
the
heavy
blows
of
the
nephites
with
their
swordsand
their
cimeters
which
brought
death
almost
at
every
strokealma


while
on
the
other
hand
there
was
now
and
then
a
man
fellamong
the
nephites
by
their
swords
and
the
loss
of
blood
theybeing
shielded
from
the
more
vital
parts
of
the
body
or
the
morevital
parts
of
the
body
being
shielded
from
the
strokes
of
thelamanites
by
their
breastplates
and
their
armshields
andtheir
headplates
and
thus
the
nephites
did
carry
on
the
work
ofdeath
among
the
lamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
became
frightenedbecause
of
the
great
destruction
among
them
even
until
theybegan
to
flee
towards
the
river
sidonalma


and
they
were
pursued
by
lehi
and
his
men
and
they
weredriven
by
lehi
into
the
waters
of
sidon
and
they
crossed
thewaters
of
sidon

and
lehi
retained
his
armies
upon
the
bank
ofthe
river
sidon
that
they
should
not
crossalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
and
his
army
met
thelamanites
in
the
valley
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
sidonand
began
to
fall
upon
them
and
to
slay
themalma


and
the
lamanites
did
flee
again
before
them
towards
theland
of
manti
and
they
were
met
again
by
the
armies
of
moronialma


now
in
this
case
the
lamanites
did
fight
exceedingly
yeanever
had
the
lamanites
been
known
to
fight
with
such
exceedinglygreat
strength
and
courage
no
not
even
from
the
beginningalma


and
they
were
inspired
by
the
zoramites
and
the
amalekiteswho
were
their
chief
captains
and
leaders
and
by
zerahemnah
whowas
their
chief
captain
or
their
chief
leader
and
commanderyea
they
did
fight
like
dragons
and
many
of
the
nephites
wereslain
by
their
hands
yea
for
they
did
smite
in
two
many
oftheir
headplates
and
they
did
pierce
many
of
theirbreastplates
and
they
did
smite
off
many
of
their
arms
and
thusthe
lamanites
did
smite
in
their
fierce
angeralma


nevertheless
the
nephites
were
inspired
by
a
better
causefor
they
were
not
fighting
for
monarchy
nor
power
but
they
werefighting
for
their
homes
and
their
liberties
their
wives
andtheir
children
and
their
all
yea
for
their
rites
of
worshipand
their
churchalma


and
they
were
doing
that
which
they
felt
was
the
duty
whichthey
owed
to
their
god
for
the
lord
had
said
unto
them
and
alsounto
their
fathers
that
Inasmuch
as
ye
are
not
guilty
of
thefirst
offense
neither
the
second
ye
shall
not
suffer
yourselvesto
be
slain
by
the
hands
of
your
enemiesalma


and
again
the
lord
has
said
that
ye
shall
defend
yourfamilies
even
unto
bloodshed

therefore
for
this
cause
were
thenephites
contending
with
the
lamanites
to
defend
themselves
andtheir
families
and
their
lands
their
country
and
their
rightsand
their
religionalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
men
of
moroni
saw
thefierceness
and
the
anger
of
the
lamanites
they
were
about
toshrink
and
flee
from
them

and
moroni
perceiving
their
intentsent
forth
and
inspired
their
hearts
with
these
thoughtsyeathe
thoughts
of
their
lands
their
liberty
yea
their
freedomfrom
bondagealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
turned
upon
the
lamanites
andthey
cried
with
one
voice
unto
the
lord
their
god
for
theirliberty
and
their
freedom
from
bondagealma


and
they
began
to
stand
against
the
lamanites
with
power
andin
that
selfsame
hour
that
they
cried
unto
the
lord
for
theirfreedom
the
lamanites
began
to
flee
before
them
and
they
fledeven
to
the
waters
of
sidonalma


now
the
lamanites
were
more
numerous
yea
by
more
thandouble
the
number
of
the
nephites
nevertheless
they
were
driveninsomuch
that
they
were
gathered
together
in
one
body
in
thevalley
upon
the
bank
by
the
river
sidonalma


therefore
the
armies
of
moroni
encircled
them
about
yeaeven
on
both
sides
of
the
river
for
behold
on
the
east
were
themen
of
lehialma


therefore
when
zerahemnah
saw
the
men
of
lehi
on
the
east
ofthe
river
sidon
and
the
armies
of
moroni
on
the
west
of
theriver
sidon
that
they
were
encircled
about
by
the
nephites
theywere
struck
with
terroralma


now
moroni
when
he
saw
their
terror
commanded
his
men
thatthey
should
stop
shedding
their
bloodalma
chapter
alma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
stop
and
withdrew
a
pacefrom
them

and
moroni
said
unto
zerahemnah
behold
zerahemnahthat
we
do
not
desire
to
be
men
of
blood

ye
know
that
ye
are
inour
hands
yet
we
do
not
desire
to
slay
youalma


behold
we
have
not
come
out
to
battle
against
you
that
wemight
shed
your
blood
for
power
neither
do
we
desire
to
bringany
one
to
the
yoke
of
bondage

but
this
is
the
very
cause
forwhich
ye
have
come
against
us
yea
and
ye
are
angry
with
usbecause
of
our
religionalma


but
now
ye
behold
that
the
lord
is
with
us
and
ye
beholdthat
he
has
delivered
you
into
our
hands

and
now
I
would
thatye
should
understand
that
this
is
done
unto
us
because
of
ourreligion
and
our
faith
in
christ

and
now
ye
see
that
ye
cannotdestroy
this
our
faithalma


now
ye
see
that
this
is
the
true
faith
of
god
yea
ye
seethat
god
will
support
and
keep
and
preserve
us
so
long
as
weare
faithful
unto
him
and
unto
our
faith
and
our
religion
andnever
will
the
lord
suffer
that
we
shall
be
destroyed
except
weshould
fall
into
transgression
and
deny
our
faithalma


and
now
zerahemnah
I
command
you
in
the
name
of
thatallpowerful
god
who
has
strengthened
our
arms
that
we
havegained
power
over
you
by
our
faith
by
our
religion
and
by
ourrites
of
worship
and
by
our
church
and
by
the
sacred
supportwhich
we
owe
to
our
wives
and
our
children
by
that
liberty
whichbinds
us
to
our
lands
and
our
country
yea
and
also
by
themaintenance
of
the
sacred
word
of
god
to
which
we
owe
all
ourhappiness
and
by
all
that
is
most
dear
unto
usalma


yea
and
this
is
not
all
I
command
you
by
all
the
desireswhich
ye
have
for
life
that
ye
deliver
up
your
weapons
of
warunto
us
and
we
will
seek
not
your
blood
but
we
will
spare
yourlives
if
ye
will
go
your
way
and
come
not
again
to
war
againstusalma


and
now
if
ye
do
not
this
behold
ye
are
in
our
hands
and
Iwill
command
my
men
that
they
shall
fall
upon
you
and
inflictthe
wounds
of
death
in
your
bodies
that
ye
may
become
extinctand
then
we
will
see
who
shall
have
power
over
this
people
yeawe
will
see
who
shall
be
brought
into
bondagealma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
zerahemnah
had
heard
thesesayings
he
came
forth
and
delivered
up
his
sword
and
his
cimeterand
his
bow
into
the
hands
of
moroni
and
said
unto
him

we
will
not

we
are
not
of
your
faith
we
do
not
believe
that
it
isgod
that
has
delivered
us
into
your
hands
but
we
believe
that
itis
your
cunning
that
has
preserved
you
from

beholdit
is
your

and
your
shields
that
have
preserved

and
now
when
zerahemnah
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
thesewords
moroni
returned
the
sword
and
the
weapons
of
war
which
hehad
received
unto
zerahemnah
saying
behold
we
will
end
theconflictalma


now
I
cannot
recall
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
thereforeas
the
lord
liveth
ye
shall
not
depart
except
ye
depart
with
anoath
that
ye
will
not

we
will
spill
your

upon

yeshall
submit
to
the
conditions
which
I
have
proposedalma


and
now
when
moroni
had
said
these
words
zerahemnah
retainedhis
sword
and
he
was
angry
with
moroni
and
he
rushed
forwardthat
he
might
slay
moroni
but
as
he
raised
his
sword
beholdone
of
moronis
soldiers
smote
it
even
to
the
earth
and
it
brokeby
the
hilt
and
he
also
smote
zerahemnah
that
he
took
off
hisscalp
and
it
fell
to
the
earth

and
zerahemnah
withdrew
frombefore
them
into
the
midst
of
his
soldiersalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
soldier
who
stood
by
who
smoteoff
the
scalp
of
zerahemnah
took
up
the
scalp
from
off
theground
by
the
hair
and
laid
it
upon
the
point
of
his
sword
andstretched
it
forth
unto
them
saying
unto
them
with
a
loud
voicealma


even
as
this
scalp
has
fallen
to
the
earth
which
is
thescalp
of
your
chief
so
shall
ye
fall
to
the
earth
except
ye
willdeliver
up
your
weapons
of
war
and
depart
with
a
covenant
ofpeacealma


now
there
were
many
when
they
heard
these
words
and
saw
thescalp
which
was
upon
the
sword
that
were
struck
with
fear
andmany
came
forth
and
threw
down
their
weapons
of
war
at
the
feetof
moroni
and
entered
into
a
covenant
of
peace

and
as
many
asentered
into
a
covenant
they
suffered
to
depart
into
thewildernessalma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
zerahemnah
was
exceedingly
wrothand
he
did
stir
up
the
remainder
of
his
soldiers
to
anger
tocontend
more
powerfully
against
the
nephitesalma


and
now
moroni
was
angry
because
of
the
stubbornness
of
thelamanites
therefore
he
commanded
his
people
that
they
shouldfall
upon
them
and
slay
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
theybegan
to
slay
them
yea
and
the
lamanites
did
contend
with
theirswords
and
their
mightalma


but
behold
their
naked
skins
and
their
bare
heads
wereexposed
to
the
sharp
swords
of
the
nephites
yea
behold
theywere
pierced
and
smitten
yea
and
did
fall
exceedingly
fastbefore
the
swords
of
the
nephites
and
they
began
to
be
sweptdown
even
as
the
soldier
of
moroni
had
prophesiedalma


now
zerahemnah
when
he
saw
that
they
were
all
about
to
bedestroyed
cried
mightily
unto
moroni
promising
that
he
wouldcovenant
and
also
his
people
with
them
if
they
would
spare
theremainder
of
their
lives
that
they
never
would
come
to
war
againagainst
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
caused
that
the
work
of
deathshould
cease
again
among
the
people

and
he
took
the
weapons
ofwar
from
the
lamanites
and
after
they
had
entered
into
acovenant
with
him
of
peace
they
were
suffered
to
depart
into
thewildernessalma


now
the
number
of
their
dead
was
not
numbered
because
of
thegreatness
of
the
number
yea
the
number
of
their
dead
wasexceedingly
great
both
on
the
nephites
and
on
the
lamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
cast
their
dead
into
thewaters
of
sidon
and
they
have
gone
forth
and
are
buried
in
thedepths
of
the
seaalma


and
the
armies
of
the
nephites
or
of
moroni
returned
andcame
to
their
houses
and
their
landsalma


and
thus
ended
the
eighteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judgesover
the
people
of
nephi

and
thus
ended
the
record
of
almawhich
was
written
upon
the
plates
of
nephialma
chapter
alma


behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
nephi
wereexceedingly
rejoiced
because
the
lord
had
again
delivered
themout
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
therefore
they
gave
thanksunto
the
lord
their
god
yea
and
they
did
fast
much
and
praymuch
and
they
did
worship
god
with
exceedingly
great
joyalma


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
nineteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudges
over
the
people
of
nephi
that
alma
came
unto
his
sonhelaman
and
said
unto
him
believest
thou
the
words
which
I
spakeunto
thee
concerning
those
records
which
have
been
keptalma


and
helaman
said
unto
him
yea
I
believealma


and
alma
said
again
believest
thou
in
jesus
christ
who
shallcomealma


and
he
said
yea
I
believe
all
the
words
which
thou
hastspokenalma


and
alma
said
unto
him
again
will
ye
keep
my
commandmentsalma


and
he
said
yea
I
will
keep
thy
commandments
with
all
myheartalma


then
alma
said
unto
him
blessed
art
thou
and
the
lord
shallprosper
thee
in
this
landalma


but
behold
I
have
somewhat
to
prophesy
unto
thee
but
what
Iprophesy
unto
thee
ye
shall
not
make
known
yea
what
I
prophesyunto
thee
shall
not
be
made
known
even
until
the
prophecy
isfulfilled
therefore
write
the
words
which
I
shall
sayalma


and
these
are
the
words
behold
I
perceive
that
this
verypeople
the
nephites
according
to
the
spirit
of
revelation
whichis
in
me
in
four
hundred
years
from
the
time
that
jesus
christshall
manifest
himself
unto
them
shall
dwindle
in
unbeliefalma


yea
and
then
shall
they
see
wars
and
pestilences
yeafamines
and
bloodshed
even
until
the
people
of
nephi
shallbecome
extinctalma


yea
and
this
because
they
shall
dwindle
in
unbelief
and
fallinto
the
works
of
darkness
and
lasciviousness
and
all
manner
ofiniquities
yea
I
say
unto
you
that
because
they
shall
sinagainst
so
great
light
and
knowledge
yea
I
say
unto
you
thatfrom
that
day
even
the
fourth
generation
shall
not
all
pass
awaybefore
this
great
iniquity
shall
comealma


and
when
that
great
day
cometh
behold
the
time
very
sooncometh
that
those
who
are
now
or
the
seed
of
those
who
are
nownumbered
among
the
people
of
nephi
shall
no
more
be
numberedamong
the
people
of
nephialma


but
whosoever
remaineth
and
is
not
destroyed
in
that
greatand
dreadful
day
shall
be
numbered
among
the
lamanites
andshall
become
like
unto
them
all
save
it
be
a
few
who
shall
becalled
the
disciples
of
the
lord
and
them
shall
the
lamanitespursue
even
until
they
shall
become
extinct

and
now
because
ofiniquity
this
prophecy
shall
be
fulfilledalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
alma
had
said
these
thingsto
helaman
he
blessed
him
and
also
his
other
sons
and
he
alsoblessed
the
earth
for
the
righteous
sakealma


and
he
said
thus
saith
the
lord
godcursed
shall
be
theland
yea
this
land
unto
every
nation
kindred
tongue
andpeople
unto
destruction
which
do
wickedly
when
they
are
fullyripe
and
as
I
have
said
so
shall
it
be
for
this
is
the
cursingand
the
blessing
of
god
upon
the
land
for
the
lord
cannot
lookupon
sin
with
the
least
degree
of
allowancealma


and
now
when
alma
had
said
these
words
he
blessed
thechurch
yea
all
those
who
should
stand
fast
in
the
faith
fromthat
time
henceforthalma


and
when
alma
had
done
this
he
departed
out
of
the
land
ofzarahemla
as
if
to
go
into
the
land
of
melek

and
it
came
topass
that
he
was
never
heard
of
more
as
to
his
death
or
burialwe
know
not
ofalma


behold
this
we
know
that
he
was
a
righteous
man
and
thesaying
went
abroad
in
the
church
that
he
was
taken
up
by
thespirit
or
buried
by
the
hand
of
the
lord
even
as
moses

butbehold
the
scriptures
saith
the
lord
took
moses
unto
himselfand
we
suppose
that
he
has
also
received
alma
in
the
spirit
untohimself
therefore
for
this
cause
we
know
nothing
concerning
hisdeath
and
burialalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
nineteenthyear
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
thathelaman
went
forth
among
the
people
to
declare
the
word
untothemalma


for
behold
because
of
their
wars
with
the
lamanites
and
themany
little
dissensions
and
disturbances
which
had
been
among
thepeople
it
became
expedient
that
the
word
of
god
should
bedeclared
among
them
yea
and
that
a
regulation
should
be
madethroughout
the
churchalma


therefore
helaman
and
his
brethren
went
forth
to
establishthe
church
again
in
all
the
land
yea
in
every
city
throughoutall
the
land
which
was
possessed
by
the
people
of
nephi

and
itcame
to
pass
that
they
did
appoint
priests
and
teachersthroughout
all
the
land
over
all
the
churchesalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
helaman
and
his
brethrenhad
appointed
priests
and
teachers
over
the
churches
that
therearose
a
dissension
among
them
and
they
would
not
give
heed
tothe
words
of
helaman
and
his
brethrenalma


but
they
grew
proud
being
lifted
up
in
their
hearts
becauseof
their
exceedingly
great
riches
therefore
they
grew
rich
intheir
own
eyes
and
would
not
give
heed
to
their
words
to
walkuprightly
before
godalma
chapter
alma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
many
as
would
not
hearken
to
thewords
of
helaman
and
his
brethren
were
gathered
together
againsttheir
brethrenalma


and
now
behold
they
were
exceedingly
wroth
insomuch
thatthey
were
determined
to
slay
themalma


now
the
leader
of
those
who
were
wroth
against
their
brethrenwas
a
large
and
a
strong
man
and
his
name
was
amalickiahalma


and
amalickiah
was
desirous
to
be
a
king
and
those
people
whowere
wroth
were
also
desirous
that
he
should
be
their
king
andthey
were
the
greater
part
of
them
the
lower
judges
of
the
landand
they
were
seeking
for
poweralma


and
they
had
been
led
by
the
flatteries
of
amalickiah
that
ifthey
would
support
him
and
establish
him
to
be
their
king
that
hewould
make
them
rulers
over
the
peoplealma


thus
they
were
led
away
by
amalickiah
to
dissensionsnotwithstanding
the
preaching
of
helaman
and
his
brethren
yeanotwithstanding
their
exceedingly
great
care
over
the
church
forthey
were
high
priests
over
the
churchalma


and
there
were
many
in
the
church
who
believed
in
theflattering
words
of
amalickiah
therefore
they
dissented
evenfrom
the
church
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
the
people
of
nephiexceedingly
precarious
and
dangerous
notwithstanding
their
greatvictory
which
they
had
had
over
the
lamanites
and
their
greatrejoicings
which
they
had
had
because
of
their
deliverance
by
thehand
of
the
lordalma


thus
we
see
how
quick
the
children
of
men
do
forget
the
lordtheir
god
yea
how
quick
to
do
iniquity
and
to
be
led
away
bythe
evil
onealma


yea
and
we
also
see
the
great
wickedness
one
very
wicked
mancan
cause
to
take
place
among
the
children
of
menalma


yea
we
see
that
amalickiah
because
he
was
a
man
of
cunningdevice
and
a
man
of
many
flattering
words
that
he
led
away
thehearts
of
many
people
to
do
wickedly
yea
and
to
seek
to
destroythe
church
of
god
and
to
destroy
the
foundation
of
liberty
whichgod
had
granted
unto
them
or
which
blessing
god
had
sent
uponthe
face
of
the
land
for
the
righteous
sakealma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
who
was
the
chiefcommander
of
the
armies
of
the
nephites
had
heard
of
thesedissensions
he
was
angry
with
amalickiahalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
rent
his
coat
and
he
took
apiece
thereof
and
wrote
upon
itIn
memory
of
our
god
ourreligion
and
freedom
and
our
peace
our
wives
and
ourchildrenand
he
fastened
it
upon
the
end
of
a
polealma


and
he
fastened
on
his
headplate
and
his
breastplate
andhis
shields
and
girded
on
his
armor
about
his
loins
and
he
tookthe
pole
which
had
on
the
end
thereof
his
rent
coat
and
hecalled
it
the
title
of
liberty
and
he
bowed
himself
to
theearth
and
he
prayed
mightily
unto
his
god
for
the
blessings
ofliberty
to
rest
upon
his
brethren
so
long
as
there
should
a
bandof
christians
remain
to
possess
the
landalma


for
thus
were
all
the
true
believers
of
christ
who
belongedto
the
church
of
god
called
by
those
who
did
not
belong
to
thechurchalma


and
those
who
did
belong
to
the
church
were
faithful
yeaall
those
who
were
true
believers
in
christ
took
upon
themgladly
the
name
of
christ
or
christians
as
they
were
calledbecause
of
their
belief
in
christ
who
should
comealma


and
therefore
at
this
time
moroni
prayed
that
the
cause
ofthe
christians
and
the
freedom
of
the
land
might
be
favoredalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
poured
out
his
soul
togod
he
named
all
the
land
which
was
south
of
the
landdesolation
yea
and
in
fine
all
the
land
both
on
the
north
andon
the
southa
chosen
land
and
the
land
of
libertyalma


and
he
said
surely
god
shall
not
suffer
that
we
who
aredespised
because
we
take
upon
us
the
name
of
christ
shall
betrodden
down
and
destroyed
until
we
bring
it
upon
us
by
our
owntransgressionsalma


and
when
moroni
had
said
these
words
he
went
forth
among
thepeople
waving
the
rent
part
of
his
garment
in
the
air
that
allmight
see
the
writing
which
he
had
written
upon
the
rent
partand
crying
with
a
loud
voice
sayingalma


behold
whosoever
will
maintain
this
title
upon
the
land
letthem
come
forth
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
and
enter
into
acovenant
that
they
will
maintain
their
rights
and
theirreligion
that
the
lord
god
may
bless
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
had
proclaimed
thesewords
behold
the
people
came
running
together
with
their
armorgirded
about
their
loins
rending
their
garments
in
token
or
asa
covenant
that
they
would
not
forsake
the
lord
their
god
orin
other
words
if
they
should
transgress
the
commandments
ofgod
or
fall
into
transgression
and
be
ashamed
to
take
upon
themthe
name
of
christ
the
lord
should
rend
them
even
as
they
hadrent
their
garmentsalma


now
this
was
the
covenant
which
they
made
and
they
casttheir
garments
at
the
feet
of
moroni
saying
we
covenant
withour
god
that
we
shall
be
destroyed
even
as
our
brethren
in
theland
northward
if
we
shall
fall
into
transgression
yea
he
maycast
us
at
the
feet
of
our
enemies
even
as
we
have
cast
ourgarments
at
thy
feet
to
be
trodden
under

if
we
shall
fallinto

moroni
said
unto
them

behold
this
was
the
language
of
jacobalma


and
now
who
knoweth
but
what
the
remnant
of
the
seed
ofjoseph
which
shall
perish
as
his
garment
are
those
who
havedissented
from
us

yea
and
even
it
shall
be
ourselves
if
we
donot
stand
fast
in
the
faith
of
christalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
had
said
these
wordshe
went
forth
and
also
sent
forth
in
all
the
parts
of
the
landwhere
there
were
dissensions
and
gathered
together
all
thepeople
who
were
desirous
to
maintain
their
liberty
to
standagainst
amalickiah
and
those
who
had
dissented
who
were
calledamalickiahitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
amalickiah
saw
that
the
peopleof
moroni
were
more
numerous
than
the
amalickiahitesand
he
alsosaw
that
his
people
were
doubtful
concerning
the
justice
of
thecause
in
which
they
had
undertakentherefore
fearing
that
heshould
not
gain
the
point
he
took
those
of
his
people
who
wouldand
departed
into
the
land
of
nephialma


now
moroni
thought
it
was
not
expedient
that
the
lamanitesshould
have
any
more
strength
therefore
he
thought
to
cut
offthe
people
of
amalickiah
or
to
take
them
and
bring
them
backand
put
amalickiah
to
death
yea
for
he
knew
that
he
would
stirup
the
lamanites
to
anger
against
them
and
cause
them
to
come
tobattle
against
them
and
this
he
knew
that
amalickiah
would
dothat
he
might
obtain
his
purposesalma


therefore
moroni
thought
it
was
expedient
that
he
should
takehis
armies
who
had
gathered
themselves
together
and
armedthemselves
and
entered
into
a
covenant
to
keep
the
peaceand
itcame
to
pass
that
he
took
his
army
and
marched
out
with
his
tentsinto
the
wilderness
to
cut
off
the
course
of
amalickiah
in
thewildernessalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
according
to
his
desires
andmarched
forth
into
the
wilderness
and
headed
the
armies
ofamalickiahalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
fled
with
a
small
numberof
his
men
and
the
remainder
were
delivered
up
into
the
hands
ofmoroni
and
were
taken
back
into
the
land
of
zarahemlaalma


now
moroni
being
a
man
who
was
appointed
by
the
chief
judgesand
the
voice
of
the
people
therefore
he
had
power
according
tohis
will
with
the
armies
of
the
nephites
to
establish
and
toexercise
authority
over
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
whomsoever
of
the
amalickiahitesthat
would
not
enter
into
a
covenant
to
support
the
cause
offreedom
that
they
might
maintain
a
free
government
he
caused
tobe
put
to
death
and
there
were
but
few
who
denied
the
covenantof
freedomalma


and
it
came
to
pass
also
that
he
caused
the
title
of
libertyto
be
hoisted
upon
every
tower
which
was
in
all
the
land
whichwas
possessed
by
the
nephites
and
thus
moroni
planted
thestandard
of
liberty
among
the
nephitesalma


and
they
began
to
have
peace
again
in
the
land
and
thus
theydid
maintain
peace
in
the
land
until
nearly
the
end
of
thenineteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judgesalma


and
helaman
and
the
high
priests
did
also
maintain
order
inthe
church
yea
even
for
the
space
of
four
years
did
they
havemuch
peace
and
rejoicing
in
the
churchalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
who
died
firmlybelieving
that
their
souls
were
redeemed
by
the
lord
jesuschrist
thus
they
went
out
of
the
world
rejoicingalma


and
there
were
some
who
died
with
fevers
which
at
someseasons
of
the
year
were
very
frequent
in
the
landbut
not
somuch
so
with
fevers
because
of
the
excellent
qualities
of
themany
plants
and
roots
which
god
had
prepared
to
remove
the
causeof
diseases
to
which
men
were
subject
by
the
nature
of
theclimatealma


but
there
were
many
who
died
with
old
age
and
those
who
diedin
the
faith
of
christ
are
happy
in
him
as

must

chapter
alma


now
we
will
return
in
our
record
to
amalickiah
and
those
whohad
fled
with
him
into
the
wilderness
for
behold
he
had
takenthose
who
went
with
him
and
went
up
in
the
land
of
nephi
amongthe
lamanites
and
did
stir
up
the
lamanites
to
anger
against
thepeople
of
nephi
insomuch
that
the
king
of
the
lamanites
sent
aproclamation
throughout
all
his
land
among
all
his
people
thatthey
should
gather
themselves
together
again
to
go
to
battleagainst
the
nephitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
proclamation
had
gone
forthamong
them
they
were
exceedingly
afraid
yea
they
feared
todisplease
the
king
and
they
also
feared
to
go
to
battle
againstthe
nephites
lest
they
should
lose
their
lives

and
it
came
topass
that
they
would
not
or
the
more
part
of
them
would
notobey
the
commandments
of
the
kingalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
was
wroth
because
oftheir
disobedience
therefore
he
gave
amalickiah
the
command
ofthat
part
of
his
army
which
was
obedient
unto
his
commands
andcommanded
him
that
he
should
go
forth
and
compel
them
to
armsalma


now
behold
this
was
the
desire
of
amalickiah
for
he
being
avery
subtle
man
to
do
evil
therefore
he
laid
the
plan
in
hisheart
to
dethrone
the
king
of
the
lamanitesalma


and
now
he
had
got
the
command
of
those
parts
of
the
lamaniteswho
were
in
favor
of
the
king
and
he
sought
to
gain
favor
ofthose
who
were
not
obedient
therefore
he
went
forward
to
theplace
which
was
called
onidah
for
thither
had
all
the
lamanitesfled
for
they
discovered
the
army
coming
and
supposing
thatthey
were
coming
to
destroy
them
therefore
they
fled
to
onidahto
the
place
of
armsalma


and
they
had
appointed
a
man
to
be
a
king
and
a
leader
overthem
being
fixed
in
their
minds
with
a
determined
resolutionthat
they
would
not
be
subjected
to
go
against
the
nephitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
had
gathered
themselves
togetherupon
the
top
of
the
mount
which
was
called
antipas
inpreparation
to
battlealma


now
it
was
not
amalickiahs
intention
to
give
them
battleaccording
to
the
commandments
of
the
king
but
behold
it
was
hisintention
to
gain
favor
with
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
that
hemight
place
himself
at
their
head
and
dethrone
the
king
and
takepossession
of
the
kingdomalma


and
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
he
caused
his
army
to
pitchtheir
tents
in
the
valley
which
was
near
the
mount
antipasalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
it
was
night
he
sent
a
secretembassy
into
the
mount
antipas
desiring
that
the
leader
of
thosewho
were
upon
the
mount
whose
name
was
lehonti
that
he
shouldcome
down
to
the
foot
of
the
mount
for
he
desired
to
speak
withhimalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
lehonti
received
the
message
hedurst
not
go
down
to
the
foot
of
the
mount

and
it
came
to
passthat
amalickiah
sent
again
the
second
time
desiring
him
to
comedown

and
it
came
to
pass
that
lehonti
would
not
and
he
sentagain
the
third
timealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
amalickiah
found
that
he
couldnot
get
lehonti
to
come
down
off
from
the
mount
he
went
up
intothe
mount
nearly
to
lehontis
camp
and
he
sent
again
the
fourthtime
his
message
unto
lehonti
desiring
that
he
would
come
downand
that
he
would
bring
his
guards
with
himalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
lehonti
had
come
down
with
hisguards
to
amalickiah
that
amalickiah
desired
him
to
come
downwith
his
army
in
the
nighttime
and
surround
those
men
in
theircamps
over
whom
the
king
had
given
him
command
and
that
he
woulddeliver
them
up
into
lehontis
hands
if
he
would
make
himamalickiah
a
second
leader
over
the
whole
armyalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
lehonti
came
down
with
his
men
andsurrounded
the
men
of
amalickiah
so
that
before
they
awoke
atthe
dawn
of
day
they
were
surrounded
by
the
armies
of
lehontialma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
saw
that
they
weresurrounded
they
plead
with
amalickiah
that
he
would
suffer
themto
fall
in
with
their
brethren
that
they
might
not
be
destroyednow
this
was
the
very
thing
which
amalickiah
desiredalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
delivered
his
men
contrary
tothe
commands
of
the
king

now
this
was
the
thing
that
amalickiahdesired
that
he
might
accomplish
his
designs
in
dethroning
thekingalma


now
it
was
the
custom
among
the
lamanites
if
their
chiefleader
was
killed
to
appoint
the
second
leader
to
be
their
chiefleaderalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
caused
that
one
of
hisservants
should
administer
poison
by
degrees
to
lehonti
that
hediedalma


now
when
lehonti
was
dead
the
lamanites
appointedamalickiah
to
be
their
leader
and
their
chief
commanderalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
marched
with
his
armiesfor
he
had
gained
his
desires
to
the
land
of
nephi
to
the
cityof
nephi
which
was
the
chief
cityalma


and
the
king
came
out
to
meet
him
with
his
guards
for
hesupposed
that
amalickiah
had
fulfilled
his
commands
and
thatamalickiah
had
gathered
together
so
great
an
army
to
go
againstthe
nephites
to
battlealma


but
behold
as
the
king
came
out
to
meet
him
amalickiahcaused
that
his
servants
should
go
forth
to
meet
the
king

andthey
went
and
bowed
themselves
before
the
king
as
if
toreverence
him
because
of
his
greatnessalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
put
forth
his
hand
to
raisethem
as
was
the
custom
with
the
lamanites
as
a
token
of
peacewhich
custom
they
had
taken
from
the
nephitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
raised
the
first
fromthe
ground
behold
he
stabbed
the
king
to
the
heart
and
he
fellto
the
earthalma


now
the
servants
of
the
king
fled
and
the
servants
ofamalickiah
raised
a
cry
sayingalma


behold
the
servants
of
the
king
have
stabbed
him
to
theheart
and
he
has
fallen
and
they
have
fled
behold
come
andseealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
commanded
that
his
armiesshould
march
forth
and
see
what
had
happened
to
the
king
andwhen
they
had
come
to
the
spot
and
found
the
king
lying
in
hisgore
amalickiah
pretended
to
be
wroth
and
said
whosoever
lovedthe
king
let
him
go
forth
and
pursue
his
servants
that
they
maybe
slainalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
all
they
who
loved
the
king
whenthey
heard
these
words
came
forth
and
pursued
after
the
servantsof
the
kingalma


now
when
the
servants
of
the
king
saw
an
army
pursuing
afterthem
they
were
frightened
again
and
fled
into
the
wildernessand
came
over
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
joined
the
people
ofammonalma


and
the
army
which
pursued
after
them
returned
havingpursued
after
them
in
vain
and
thus
amalickiah
by
his
fraudgained
the
hearts
of
the
peoplealma


and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
he
entered
the
city
nephiwith
his
armies
and
took
possession
of
the
cityalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
queen
when
she
had
heardthat
the
king
was
slainfor
amalickiah
had
sent
an
embassy
tothe
queen
informing
her
that
the
king
had
been
slain
by
hisservants
that
he
had
pursued
them
with
his
army
but
it
was
invain
and
they
had
made
their
escapealma


therefore
when
the
queen
had
received
this
message
she
sentunto
amalickiah
desiring
him
that
he
would
spare
the
people
ofthe
city
and
she
also
desired
him
that
he
should
come
in
untoher
and
she
also
desired
him
that
he
should
bring
witnesses
withhim
to
testify
concerning
the
death
of
the
kingalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
took
the
same
servantthat
slew
the
king
and
all
them
who
were
with
him
and
went
inunto
the
queen
unto
the
place
where
she
sat
and
they
alltestified
unto
her
that
the
king
was
slain
by
his
own
servantsand
they
said
also
they
have
fled
does
not
this
testify
againstthem


and
thus
they
satisfied
the
queen
concerning
the
death
ofthe
kingalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
sought
the
favor
of
thequeen
and
took
her
unto
him
to
wife
and
thus
by
his
fraud
andby
the
assistance
of
his
cunning
servants
he
obtained
thekingdom
yea
he
was
acknowledged
king
throughout
all
the
landamong
all
the
people
of
the
lamanites
who
were
composed
of
thelamanites
and
the
lemuelites
and
the
Ishmaelites
and
all
thedissenters
of
the
nephites
from
the
reign
of
nephi
down
to
thepresent
timealma


now
these
dissenters
having
the
same
instruction
and
thesame
information
of
the
nephites
yea
having
been
instructed
inthe
same
knowledge
of
the
lord
nevertheless
it
is
strange
torelate
not
long
after
their
dissensions
they
became
morehardened
and
impenitent
and
more
wild
wicked
and
ferocious
thanthe
lamanitesdrinking
in
with
the
traditions
of
the
lamanitesgiving
way
to
indolence
and
all
manner
of
lasciviousness
yeaentirely
forgetting
the
lord
their
godalma
chapter
alma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
as
soon
as
amalickiah
hadobtained
the
kingdom
he
began
to
inspire
the
hearts
of
thelamanites
against
the
people
of
nephi
yea
he
did
appoint
men
tospeak
unto
the
lamanites
from
their
towers
against
the
nephitesalma


and
thus
he
did
inspire
their
hearts
against
the
nephitesinsomuch
that
in
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
year
of
thereign
of
the
judges
he
having
accomplished
his
designs
thus
faryea
having
been
made
king
over
the
lamanites
he
sought
also
toreign
over
all
the
land
yea
and
all
the
people
who
were
in
theland
the
nephites
as
well
as
the
lamanitesalma


therefore
he
had
accomplished
his
design
for
he
had
hardenedthe
hearts
of
the
lamanites
and
blinded
their
minds
and
stirredthem
up
to
anger
insomuch
that
he
had
gathered
together
anumerous
host
to
go
to
battle
against
the
nephitesalma


for
he
was
determined
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
numberof
his
people
to
overpower
the
nephites
and
to
bring
them
intobondagealma


and
thus
he
did
appoint
chief
captains
of
the
zoramites
theybeing
the
most
acquainted
with
the
strength
of
the
nephites
andtheir
places
of
resort
and
the
weakest
parts
of
their
citiestherefore
he
appointed
them
to
be
chief
captains
over
his
armiesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
their
camp
and
moved
forthtoward
the
land
of
zarahemla
in
the
wildernessalma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
while
amalickiah
had
thus
beenobtaining
power
by
fraud
and
deceit
moroni
on
the
other
handhad
been
preparing
the
minds
of
the
people
to
be
faithful
untothe
lord
their
godalma


yea
he
had
been
strengthening
the
armies
of
the
nephites
anderecting
small
forts
or
places
of
resort
throwing
up
banks
ofearth
round
about
to
enclose
his
armies
and
also
building
wallsof
stone
to
encircle
them
about
round
about
their
cities
and
theborders
of
their
lands
yea
all
round
about
the
landalma


and
in
their
weakest
fortifications
he
did
place
the
greaternumber
of
men
and
thus
he
did
fortify
and
strengthen
the
landwhich
was
possessed
by
the
nephitesalma


and
thus
he
was
preparing
to
support
their
liberty
theirlands
their
wives
and
their
children
and
their
peace
and
thatthey
might
live
unto
the
lord
their
god
and
that
they
mightmaintain
that
which
was
called
by
their
enemies

cause
ofchristiansalma


and
moroni
was
a
strong
and
a
mighty
man
he
was
a
man
of
aperfect
understanding

a
man
that
did
not
delight
inbloodshed
a
man
whose
soul
did
joy
in
the
liberty

of

yea
a
man
whose
heart
did
swell
with
thanksgiving
to
hisgod
for
the
many
privileges
and
blessings
which
he
bestowed
uponhis
people
a
man
who
did
labor
exceedingly
for
the
welfare

he
was

man
who
was
firm
in
the
faith
of
christand
he
had
sworn
with
an
oath
to
defend
his
people
his
rightsand
his
country
and
his
religion
even
to
the
loss
of
his
bloodalma


now
the
nephites
were
taught
to
defend
themselves
againsttheir
enemies
even
to
the
shedding
of
blood
if
it
werenecessary
yea
and
they
were
also
taught
never
to
give
anoffense
yea
and
never
to
raise
the
sword
except
it
were
againstan
enemy
except
it
were
to
preserve
their
livesalma


and
this
was
their
faith
that
by
so
doing
god
would
prosperthem
in
the
land
or
in
other
words
if
they
were
faithful
inkeeping
the
commandments
of
god
that
he
would
prosper
them
in
theland
yea
warn
them
to
flee
or
to
prepare
for
war
according
totheir
dangeralma


and
also
that
god
would
make
it
known
unto
them
whither
theyshould
go
to
defend
themselves
against
their
enemies
and
by
sodoing
the
lord
would
deliver
them
and
this
was
the
faith
ofmoroni
and
his
heart
did
glory
in
it
not
in
the
shedding
ofblood
but
in
doing
good
in
preserving
his
people
yea
inkeeping
the
commandments
of
god
yea
and
resisting
iniquityalma


yea
verily
verily
I
say
unto
you
if
all
men
had
been
andwere
and
ever
would
be
like
unto
moroni
behold
the
verypowers
of
hell
would
have
been
shaken
forever
yea
the
devilwould
never
have
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
menalma


behold
he
was
a
man
like
unto
ammon
the
son
of
mosiah
yeaand
even
the
other
sons
of
mosiah
yea
and
also
alma
and
hissons
for
they
were
all
men
of
godalma


now
behold
helaman
and
his
brethren
were
no
less
serviceableunto
the
people
than
was
moroni
for
they
did
preach
the
word
ofgod
and
they
did
baptize
unto
repentance
all
men
whosoever
wouldhearken
unto
their
wordsalma


and
thus
they
went
forth
and
the
people
did
humblethemselves
because
of
their
words
insomuch
that
they
were
highlyfavored
of
the
lord
and
thus
they
were
free
from
wars
andcontentions
among
themselves
yea
even
for
the
space
of
fouryearsalma


but
as
I
have
said
in
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenthyear
yea
notwithstanding
their
peace
amongst
themselves
theywere
compelled
reluctantly
to
contend
with
their
brethren
thelamanitesalma


yea
and
in
fine
their
wars
never
did
cease
for
the
space
ofmany
years
with
the
lamanites
notwithstanding
their
muchreluctancealma


now
they
were
sorry
to
take
up
arms
against
the
lamanitesbecause
they
did
not
delight
in
the
shedding
of
blood
yea
andthis
was
not
allthey
were
sorry
to
be
the
means
of
sending
somany
of
their
brethren
out
of
this
world
into
an
eternal
worldunprepared
to
meet
their
godalma


nevertheless
they
could
not
suffer
to
lay
down
their
livesthat
their
wives
and
their
children
should
be
massacred
by
thebarbarous
cruelty
of
those
who
were
once
their
brethren
yea
andhad
dissented
from
their
church
and
had
left
them
and
had
goneto
destroy
them
by
joining
the
lamanitesalma


yea
they
could
not
bear
that
their
brethren
should
rejoiceover
the
blood
of
the
nephites
so
long
as
there
were
any
whoshould
keep
the
commandments
of
god
for
the
promise
of
the
lordwas
if
they
should
keep
his
commandments
they
should
prosper
inthe
landalma

alma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
month
of
thenineteenth
year
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
the
armies
of
thelamanites
were
seen
approaching
towards
the
land
of
ammonihahalma


and
behold
the
city
had
been
rebuilt
and
moroni
hadstationed
an
army
by
the
borders
of
the
city
and
they
had
castup
dirt
around
about
to
shield
them
from
the
arrows
and
thestones
of
the
lamanites
for
behold
they
fought
with
stones
andwith
arrowsalma


behold
I
said
that
the
city
of
ammonihah
had
been
rebuilt

Isay
unto
you
yea
that
it
was
in
part
rebuilt
and
because
thelamanites
had
destroyed
it
once
because
of
the
iniquity
of
thepeople
they
supposed
that
it
would
again
become
an
easy
prey
forthemalma


but
behold
how
great
was
their
disappointment
for
beholdthe
nephites
had
dug
up
a
ridge
of
earth
round
about
them
whichwas
so
high
that
the
lamanites
could
not
cast
their
stones
andtheir
arrows
at
them
that
they
might
take
effect
neither
couldthey
come
upon
them
save
it
was
by
their
place
of
entrancealma


now
at
this
time
the
chief
captains
of
the
lamanites
wereastonished
exceedingly
because
of
the
wisdom
of
the
nephites
inpreparing
their
places
of
securityalma


now
the
leaders
of
the
lamanites
had
supposed
because
of
thegreatness
of
their
numbers
yea
they
supposed
that
they
shouldbe
privileged
to
come
upon
them
as
they
had
hitherto
done
yeaand
they
had
also
prepared
themselves
with
shields
and
withbreastplates
and
they
had
also
prepared
themselves
with
garmentsof
skins
yea
very
thick
garments
to
cover
their
nakednessalma


and
being
thus
prepared
they
supposed
that
they
should
easilyoverpower
and
subject
their
brethren
to
the
yoke
of
bondage
orslay
and
massacre
them
according
to
their
pleasurealma


but
behold
to
their
uttermost
astonishment
they
wereprepared
for
them
in
a
manner
which
never
had
been
known
amongthe
children
of
lehi

now
they
were
prepared
for
the
lamanitesto
battle
after
the
manner
of
the
instructions
of
moronialma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
or
the
amalickiahiteswere
exceedingly
astonished
at
their
manner
of
preparation
forwaralma


now
if
king
amalickiah
had
come
down
out
of
the
land
ofnephi
at
the
head
of
his
army
perhaps
he
would
have
caused
thelamanites
to
have
attacked
the
nephites
at
the
city
of
ammonihahfor
behold
he
did
care
not
for
the
blood
of
his
peoplealma


but
behold
amalickiah
did
not
come
down
himself
to
battle
and
behold
his
chief
captains
durst
not
attack
the
nephites
atthe
city
of
ammonihah
for
moroni
had
altered
the
management
ofaffairs
among
the
nephites
insomuch
that
the
lamanites
weredisappointed
in
their
places
of
retreat
and
they
could
not
comeupon
themalma


therefore
they
retreated
into
the
wilderness
and
took
theircamp
and
marched
towards
the
land
of
noah
supposing
that
to
bethe
next
best
place
for
them
to
come
against
the
nephitesalma


for
they
knew
not
that
moroni
had
fortified
or
had
builtforts
of
security
for
every
city
in
all
the
land
round
abouttherefore
they
marched
forward
to
the
land
of
noah
with
a
firmdetermination
yea
their
chief
captains
came
forward
and
took
anoath
that
they
would
destroy
the
people
of
that
cityalma


but
behold
to
their
astonishment
the
city
of
noah
whichhad
hitherto
been
a
weak
place
had
now
by
the
means
of
moronibecome
strong
yea
even
to
exceed
the
strength
of
the
cityammonihahalma


and
now
behold
this
was
wisdom
in
moroni
for
he
hadsupposed
that
they
would
be
frightened
at
the
city
ammonihah
andas
the
city
of
noah
had
hitherto
been
the
weakest
part
of
theland
therefore
they
would
march
thither
to
battle
and
thus
itwas
according
to
his
desiresalma


and
behold
moroni
had
appointed
lehi
to
be
chief
captainover
the
men
of
that
city
and
it
was
that
same
lehi
who
foughtwith
the
lamanites
in
the
valley
on
the
east
of
the
river
sidonalma


and
now
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
hadfound
that
lehi
commanded
the
city
they
were
again
disappointedfor
they
feared
lehi
exceedingly
nevertheless
their
chiefcaptains
had
sworn
with
an
oath
to
attack
the
city
thereforethey
brought
up
their
armiesalma


now
behold
the
lamanites
could
not
get
into
their
forts
ofsecurity
by
any
other
way
save
by
the
entrance
because
of
thehighness
of
the
bank
which
had
been
thrown
up
and
the
depth
ofthe
ditch
which
had
been
dug
round
about
save
it
were
by
theentrancealma


and
thus
were
the
nephites
prepared
to
destroy
all
such
asshould
attempt
to
climb
up
to
enter
the
fort
by
any
other
way
bycasting
over
stones
and
arrows
at
themalma


thus
they
were
prepared
yea
a
body
of
their
strongest
menwith
their
swords
and
their
slings
to
smite
down
all
who
shouldattempt
to
come
into
their
place
of
security
by
the
place
ofentrance
and
thus
were
they
prepared
to
defend
themselvesagainst
the
lamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
captains
of
the
lamanitesbrought
up
their
armies
before
the
place
of
entrance
and
beganto
contend
with
the
nephites
to
get
into
their
place
ofsecurity
but
behold
they
were
driven
back
from
time
to
timeinsomuch
that
they
were
slain
with
an
immense
slaughteralma


now
when
they
found
that
they
could
not
obtain
power
over
thenephites
by
the
pass
they
began
to
dig
down
their
banks
of
earththat
they
might
obtain
a
pass
to
their
armies
that
they
mighthave
an
equal
chance
to
fight
but
behold
in
these
attempts
theywere
swept
off
by
the
stones
and
arrows
which
were
thrown
atthem
and
instead
of
filling
up
their
ditches
by
pulling
down
thebanks
of
earth
they
were
filled
up
in
a
measure
with
their
deadand
wounded
bodiesalma


thus
the
nephites
had
all
power
over
their
enemies
and
thusthe
lamanites
did
attempt
to
destroy
the
nephites
until
theirchief
captains
were
all
slain
yea
and
more
than
a
thousand
ofthe
lamanites
were
slain
while
on
the
other
hand
there
was
nota
single
soul
of
the
nephites
which
was
slainalma


there
were
about
fifty
who
were
wounded
who
had
been
exposedto
the
arrows
of
the
lamanites
through
the
pass
but
they
wereshielded
by
their
shields
and
their
breastplates
and
theirheadplates
insomuch
that
their
wounds
were
upon
their
legsmany
of
which
were
very
severealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
theirchief
captains
were
all
slain
they
fled
into
the
wilderness

andit
came
to
pass
that
they
returned
to
the
land
of
nephi
toinform
their
king
amalickiah
who
was
a
nephite
by
birthconcerning
their
great
lossalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
exceedingly
angry
with
hispeople
because
he
had
not
obtained
his
desire
over
the
nephiteshe
had
not
subjected
them
to
the
yoke
of
bondagealma


yea
he
was
exceedingly
wroth
and
he
did
curse
god
and
alsomoroni
swearing
with
an
oath
that
he
would
drink
his
blood
andthis
because
moroni
had
kept
the
commandments
of
god
in
preparingfor
the
safety
of
his
peoplealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
other
hand
the
people
ofnephi
did
thank
the
lord
their
god
because
of
his
matchlesspower
in
delivering
them
from
the
hands
of
their
enemiesalma


and
thus
ended
the
nineteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judgesover
the
people
of
nephialma


yea
and
there
was
continual
peace
among
them
andexceedingly
great
prosperity
in
the
church
because
of
their
heedand
diligence
which
they
gave
unto
the
word
of
god
which
wasdeclared
unto
them
by
helaman
and
shiblon
and
corianton
andammon
and
his
brethren
yea
and
by
all
those
who
had
beenordained
by
the
holy
order
of
god
being
baptized
untorepentance
and
sent
forth
to
preach
among
the
peoplealma
chapter
alma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
did
not
stop
makingpreparations
for
war
or
to
defend
his
people
against
thelamanites
for
he
caused
that
his
armies
should
commence
in
thecommencement
of
the
twentieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judgesthat
they
should
commence
in
digging
up
heaps
of
earth
roundabout
all
the
cities
throughout
all
the
land
which
was
possessedby
the
nephitesalma


and
upon
the
top
of
these
ridges
of
earth
he
caused
that
thereshould
be
timbers
yea
works
of
timbers
built
up
to
the
heightof
a
man
round
about
the
citiesalma


and
he
caused
that
upon
those
works
of
timbers
there
should
bea
frame
of
pickets
built
upon
the
timbers
round
about
and
theywere
strong
and
highalma


and
he
caused
towers
to
be
erected
that
overlooked
those
worksof
pickets
and
he
caused
places
of
security
to
be
built
uponthose
towers
that
the
stones
and
the
arrows
of
the
lamanitescould
not
hurt
themalma


and
they
were
prepared
that
they
could
cast
stones
from
thetop
thereof
according
to
their
pleasure
and
their
strength
andslay
him
who
should
attempt
to
approach
near
the
walls
of
thecityalma


thus
moroni
did
prepare
strongholds
against
the
coming
oftheir
enemies
round
about
every
city
in
all
the
landalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
caused
that
his
armies
shouldgo
forth
into
the
east
wilderness
yea
and
they
went
forth
anddrove
all
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
east
wilderness
intotheir
own
lands
which
were
south
of
the
land
of
zarahemlaalma


and
the
land
of
nephi
did
run
in
a
straight
course
from
theeast
sea
to
the
westalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
had
driven
all
thelamanites
out
of
the
east
wilderness
which
was
north
of
thelands
of
their
own
possessions
he
caused
that
the
inhabitantswho
were
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
in
the
land
round
aboutshould
go
forth
into
the
east
wilderness
even
to
the
borders
bythe
seashore
and
possess
the
landalma


and
he
also
placed
armies
on
the
south
in
the
borders
oftheir
possessions
and
caused
them
to
erect
fortifications
thatthey
might
secure
their
armies
and
their
people
from
the
hands
oftheir
enemiesalma


and
thus
he
cut
off
all
the
strongholds
of
the
lamanites
inthe
east
wilderness
yea
and
also
on
the
west
fortifying
theline
between
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
between
the
land
ofzarahemla
and
the
land
of
nephi
from
the
west
sea
running
bythe
head
of
the
river
sidonthe
nephites
possessing
all
the
landnorthward
yea
even
all
the
land
which
was
northward
of
the
landbountiful
according
to
their
pleasurealma


thus
moroni
with
his
armies
which
did
increase
dailybecause
of
the
assurance
of
protection
which
his
works
did
bringforth
unto
them
did
seek
to
cut
off
the
strength
and
the
powerof
the
lamanites
from
off
the
lands
of
their
possessions
thatthey
should
have
no
power
upon
the
lands
of
their
possessionalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
began
the
foundation
ofa
city
and
they
called
the
name
of
the
city
moroni
and
it
wasby
the
east
sea
and
it
was
on
the
south
by
the
line
of
thepossessions
of
the
lamanitesalma


and
they
also
began
a
foundation
for
a
city
between
the
cityof
moroni
and
the
city
of
aaron
joining
the
borders
of
aaron
andmoroni
and
they
called
the
name
of
the
city
or
the
landnephihahalma


and
they
also
began
in
that
same
year
to
build
many
cities
onthe
north
one
in
a
particular
manner
which
they
called
lehiwhich
was
in
the
north
by
the
borders
of
the
seashorealma


and
thus
ended
the
twentieth
yearalma


and
in
these
prosperous
circumstances
were
the
people
ofnephi
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
first
year
of
thereign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephialma


and
they
did
prosper
exceedingly
and
they
became
exceedinglyrich
yea
and
they
did
multiply
and
wax
strong
in
the
landalma


and
thus
we
see
how
merciful
and
just
are
all
the
dealings
ofthe
lord
to
the
fulfilling
of
all
his
words
unto
the
children
ofmen
yea
we
can
behold
that
his
words
are
verified
even
at
thistime
which
he
spake
unto
lehi
sayingalma


blessed
art
thou
and
thy
children
and
they
shall
be
blessedinasmuch
as
they
shall
keep
my
commandments
they
shall
prosper
inthe
land


but
remember
inasmuch
as
they
will
not
keep
mycommandments
they
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lordalma


and
we
see
that
these
promises
have
been
verified
to
thepeople
of
nephi
for
it
has
been
their
quarrelings
and
theircontentions
yea
their
murderings
and
their
plunderings
theiridolatry
their
whoredoms
and
their
abominations
which
wereamong
themselves
which
brought
upon
them
their
wars
and
theirdestructionsalma


and
those
who
were
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
ofthe
lord
were
delivered
at
all
times
whilst
thousands
of
theirwicked

but
behold
there
never
was
a
happier
time
among

since
the
days
of

in
the
days
of
moroni
yeaeven
at
this
time
in

twenty
and

year
of

reign
ofthe

and
it
came
to

that
the
twenty
and
second
year
of
thereign
of
the
judges
also
ended
in
peace
yea
and
also
the
twentyand
third

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
commencement
of
the
twentyand
fourth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
there
would
also
havebeen
peace
among
the
people
of
nephi
had
it
not
been
for
acontention
which
took
place
among
them
concerning
the
land
oflehi
and
the
land
of
morianton
which
joined
upon
the
borders
oflehi
both
of
which
were
on
the
borders
by
the
seashorealma


for
behold
the
people
who
possessed
the
land
of
moriantondid
claim
a
part
of
the
land
of
lehi
therefore
there
began
to
bea
warm
contention
between
them
insomuch
that
the
people
ofmorianton
took
up
arms
against
their
brethren
and
they
weredetermined
by
the
sword
to
slay
themalma


but
behold
the
people
who
possessed
the
land
of
lehi
fled
tothe
camp
of
moroni
and
appealed
unto
him
for
assistance
forbehold
they
were
not
in
the
wrongalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
people
of
morianton
whowere
led
by
a
man
whose
name
was
morianton
found
that
the
peopleof
lehi
had
fled
to
the
camp
of
moroni
they
were
exceedinglyfearful
lest
the
army
of
moroni
should
come
upon
them
and
destroythemalma


therefore
morianton
put
it
into
their
hearts
that
theyshould
flee
to
the
land
which
was
northward
which
was
coveredwith
large
bodies
of
water
and
take
possession
of
the
land
whichwas
northwardalma


and
behold
they
would
have
carried
this
plan
into
effectwhich
would
have
been
a
cause
to
have
been
lamented
but
beholdmorianton
being
a
man
of
much
passion
therefore
he
was
angrywith
one
of
his
maid
servants
and
he
fell
upon
her
and
beat
hermuchalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
she
fled
and
came
over
to
the
campof
moroni
and
told
moroni
all
things
concerning
the
matter
andalso
concerning
their
intentions
to
flee
into
the
land
northwardalma


now
behold
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
bountiful
orrather
moroni
feared
that
they
would
hearken
to
the
words
ofmorianton
and
unite
with
his
people
and
thus
he
would
obtainpossession
of
those
parts
of
the
land
which
would
lay
afoundation
for
serious
consequences
among
the
people
of
nephiyea
which
consequences
would
lead
to
the
overthrow
of
theirlibertyalma


therefore
moroni
sent
an
army
with
their
camp
to
head
thepeople
of
morianton
to
stop
their
flight
into
the
landnorthwardalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
not
head
them
until
theyhad
come
to
the
borders
of
the
land
desolation
and
there
theydid
head
them
by
the
narrow
pass
which
led
by
the
sea
into
theland
northward
yea
by
the
sea
on
the
west
and
on
the
eastalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
army
which
was
sent
by
moroniwhich
was
led
by
a
man
whose
name
was
teancum
did
meet
thepeople
of
morianton
and
so
stubborn
were
the
people
ofmorianton
being
inspired
by
his
wickedness
and
his
flatteringwords
that
a
battle
commenced
between
them
in
the
which
teancumdid
slay
morianton
and
defeat
his
army
and
took
them
prisonersand
returned
to
the
camp
of
moroni

and
thus
ended
the
twentyand
fourth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
ofnephialma


and
thus
were
the
people
of
morianton
brought
back

and
upontheir
covenanting
to
keep
the
peace
they
were
restored
to
theland
of
morianton
and
a
union
took
place
between
them
and
thepeople
of
lehi
and
they
were
also
restored
to
their
landsalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
same
year
that
the
people
ofnephi
had
peace
restored
unto
them
that
nephihah
the
secondchief
judge
died
having
filled
the
judgmentseat
with
perfectuprightness
before

nevertheless
he
had
refused

to
take
possession
of
thoserecords
and
those
things
which
were
esteemed
by
alma
and
hisfathers
to
be
most
sacred
therefore
alma
had
conferred
them
uponhis
son
helamanalma


behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
son
of
nephihah
wasappointed
to
fill
the
judgmentseat
in
the
stead
of
his
fatheryea
he
was
appointed
chief
judge
and
governor
over
the
peoplewith
an
oath
and
sacred
ordinance
to
judge
righteously
and
tokeep
the

now
behold
his
name
was
pahoran

and
pahoran
did
fill
theseat
of
his
father
and
did
commence
his
reign
in
the
end
of

and
fourth

chapter
alma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
andfifth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephithey
having
established
peace
between
the
people
of
lehi
and
thepeople
of
morianton
concerning
their
lands
and
having
commencedthe
twenty
and
fifth
year
in
peacealma


nevertheless
they
did
not
long
maintain
an
entire
peace
inthe
land
for
there
began
to
be
a
contention
among
the
peopleconcerning
the
chief
judge
pahoran
for
behold
there
were
a
partof
the
people
who
desired
that
a
few
particular
points
of
the
lawshould
be
alteredalma


but
behold
pahoran
would
not
alter
nor
suffer
the
law
to
bealtered
therefore
he
did
not
hearken
to
those
who
had
sent
intheir
voices
with
their
petitions
concerning
the
altering
of
thelawalma


therefore
those
who
were
desirous
that
the
law
should
bealtered
were
angry
with
him
and
desired
that
he
should
no
longerbe
chief
judge
over
the
land
therefore
there
arose
a
warmdispute
concerning
the
matter
but
not
unto
bloodshedalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
who
were
desirous
that
pahoranshould
be
dethroned
from
the
judgmentseat
were
called
kingmenfor
they
were
desirous
that
the
law
should
be
altered
in
a
mannerto
overthrow
the
free
government
and
to
establish
a
king
over
thelandalma


and
those
who
were
desirous
that
pahoran
should
remain
chiefjudge
over
the
land
took
upon
them
the
name
of
freemen
and
thuswas
the
division
among
them
for
the
freemen
had
sworn
orcovenanted
to
maintain
their
rights
and
the
privileges
of
theirreligion
by
a
free
governmentalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
this
matter
of
their
contention
wassettled
by
the
voice
of
the
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
thevoice
of
the
people
came
in
favor
of
the
freemen
and
pahoranretained
the
judgmentseat
which
caused
much
rejoicing
among
thebrethren
of
pahoran
and
also
many
of
the
people
of
liberty
whoalso
put
the
kingmen
to
silence
that
they
durst
not
oppose
butwere
obliged
to
maintain
the
cause
of
freedomalma


now
those
who
were
in
favor
of
kings
were
those
of
high
birthand
they
sought
to
be
kings
and
they
were
supported
by
those
whosought
power
and
authority
over
the
peoplealma


but
behold
this
was
a
critical
time
for
such
contentions
tobe
among
the
people
of
nephi
for
behold
amalickiah
had
againstirred
up
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
the
lamanites
against
thepeople
of
the
nephites
and
he
was
gathering
together
soldiersfrom
all
parts
of
his
land
and
arming
them
and
preparing
forwar
with
all
diligence
for
he
had
sworn
to
drink
the
blood
ofmoronialma


but
behold
we
shall
see
that
his
promise
which
he
made
wasrash
nevertheless
he
did
prepare
himself
and
his
armies
to
cometo
battle
against
the
nephitesalma


now
his
armies
were
not
so
great
as
they
had
hitherto
beenbecause
of
the
many
thousands
who
had
been
slain
by
the
hand
ofthe
nephites
but
notwithstanding
their
great
loss
amalickiahhad
gathered
together
a
wonderfully
great
army
insomuch
that
hefeared
not
to
come
down
to
the
land
of
zarahemlaalma


yea
even
amalickiah
did
himself
come
down
at
the
head
ofthe
lamanites

and
it
was
in
the
twenty
and
fifth
year
of
thereign
of
the
judges
and
it
was
at
the
same
time
that
they
hadbegun
to
settle
the
affairs
of
their
contentions
concerning
thechief
judge
pahoranalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
men
who
were
calledkingmen
had
heard
that
the
lamanites
were
coming
down
to
battleagainst
them
they
were
glad
in
their
hearts
and
they
refused
totake
up
arms
for
they
were
so
wroth
with
the
chief
judge
andalso
with
the
people
of
liberty
that
they
would
not
take
up
armsto
defend
their
countryalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
saw
this
and
also
sawthat
the
lamanites
were
coming
into
the
borders
of
the
land
hewas
exceedingly
wroth
because
of
the
stubbornness
of
those
peoplewhom
he
had
labored
with
so
much
diligence
to
preserve
yea
hewas
exceedingly
wroth
his
soul
was
filled
with
anger
againstthemalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
sent
a
petition
with
the
voiceof
the
people
unto
the
governor
of
the
land
desiring
that
heshould
read
it
and
give
him
moroni
power
to
compel
thosedissenters
to
defend
their
country
or
to
put
them
to
deathalma


for
it
was
his
first
care
to
put
an
end
to
such
contentionsand
dissensions
among
the
people
for
behold
this
had
beenhitherto
a
cause
of
all
their
destruction

and
it
came
to
passthat
it
was
granted
according
to
the
voice
of
the
peoplealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
commanded
that
his
armyshould
go
against
those
kingmen
to
pull
down
their
pride
andtheir
nobility
and
level
them
with
the
earth
or
they
should
takeup
arms
and
support
the
cause
of
libertyalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
did
march
forth
againstthem
and
they
did
pull
down
their
pride
and
their
nobilityinsomuch
that
as
they
did
lift
their
weapons
of
war
to
fightagainst
the
men
of
moroni
they
were
hewn
down
and
leveled
to
theearthalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
four
thousand
of
thosedissenters
who
were
hewn
down
by
the
sword
and
those
of
theirleaders
who
were
not
slain
in
battle
were
taken
and
cast
intoprison
for
there
was
no
time
for
their
trials
at
this
periodalma


and
the
remainder
of
those
dissenters
rather
than
be
smittendown
to
the
earth
by
the
sword
yielded
to
the
standard
ofliberty
and
were
compelled
to
hoist
the
title
of
liberty
upontheir
towers
and
in
their
cities
and
to
take
up
arms
in
defenceof
their
countryalma


and
thus
moroni
put
an
end
to
those
kingmen
that
there
werenot
any
known
by
the
appellation
of
kingmen
and
thus
he
put
anend
to
the
stubbornness
and
the
pride
of
those
people
whoprofessed
the
blood
of
nobility
but
they
were
brought
down
tohumble
themselves
like
unto
their
brethren
and
to
fightvaliantly
for
their
freedom
from
bondagealma


behold
it
came
to
pass
that
while
moroni
was
thus
breakingdown
the
wars
and
contentions
among
his
own
people
andsubjecting
them
to
peace
and
civilization
and
making
regulationsto
prepare
for
war
against
the
lamanites
behold
the
lamaniteshad
come
into
the
land
of
moroni
which
was
in
the
borders
by
theseashorealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
were
not
sufficientlystrong
in
the
city
of
moroni
therefore
amalickiah
did
drivethem
slaying
many

and
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
tookpossession
of
the
city
yea
possession
of
all
theirfortificationsalma


and
those
who
fled
out
of
the
city
of
moroni
came
to
the
cityof
nephihah
and
also
the
people
of
the
city
of
lehi
gatheredthemselves
together
and
made
preparations
and
were
ready
toreceive
the
lamanites
to
battlealma


but
it
came
to
pass
that
amalickiah
would
not
suffer
thelamanites
to
go
against
the
city
of
nephihah
to
battle
but
keptthem
down
by
the
seashore
leaving
men
in
every
city
to
maintainand
defend
italma


and
thus
he
went
on
taking
possession
of
many
cities
thecity
of
nephihah
and
the
city
of
lehi
and
the
city
ofmorianton
and
the
city

and
the
city
of
gid
and
thecity
of
mulek
all
of
which
were
on
the
east
borders
by
theseashorealma


and
thus
had
the
lamanites
obtained
by
the
cunning
ofamalickiah
so
many
cities
by
their
numberless
hosts
all
ofwhich
were
strongly
fortified
after
the
manner
of
thefortifications
of
moroni
all
of
which
afforded
strongholds
forthe
lamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
marched
to
the
borders
of
theland
bountiful
driving
the
nephites
before
them

slayingmanyalma


but
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
met
by
teancum
who
hadslain
morianton
and
had
headed
his
people
in
his
flightalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
headed
amalickiah
also
as
he
wasmarching
forth
with
his
numerous
army
that
he
might
takepossession
of
the
land
bountiful
and
also
the

northwardalma


but
behold
he
met
with
a
disappointment
by
being
repulsed

and
his
men
for
they
were
great
warriors
for
every
manof
teancum
did
exceed
the
lamanites
in
their
strength
and
intheir
skill
of
war
insomuch
that
they
did
gain
advantage
overthe
lamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
harass
them
insomuch
thatthey
did
slay
them
even
until
it
was
dark

and
it
came
to
passthat
teancum
and
his
men
did
pitch
their
tents
in
the
borders
ofthe
land
bountiful

amalickiah
did
pitch
his
tents
in
theborders
on
the
beach
by
the
seashore

after
this
manner

drivenalma


and
it
came
to

that
when

night
had
come

stole
forth
and
went
out
by
night
and
went
into

much
fatigue
which
was
caused
by
the
labors

of
the

and
it
came
to

that
teancum
stole
privily
into

tentof
the
king
and
put
a
javelin
to

heart

he
did
cause

of

he
awoke

and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
of
thereign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of

behold
when
thelamanites
awoke
on
the
first
morning
of
the
first
month
beholdthey
found
amalickiah
was
dead
in
his
own
tent
and
they
also
sawthat
teancum
was
ready
to
give
them
battle
on
that
dayalma


and
now
when
the
lamanites
saw
this
they
were
affrighted
andthey
abandoned
their
design
in
marching
into
the
land
northwardand
retreated
with
all
their
army
into
the
city
of
mulek
andsought
protection
in
their
fortificationsalma


and
it
came
to

to

did
command
that

they
had
taken

the
shedding
ofblood
for
they
had
not
taken
any
cities

they
had
lost
muchbloodalma


and
now
teancum
saw
that
the
lamanites
were
determined
tomaintain
those
cities
which
they
had
taken
and
those
parts
ofthe
land
which
they
had
obtained
possession
of
and
also
seeingthe
enormity
of
their
number
teancum
thought
it
was
notexpedient
that
he
should
attempt
to
attack
them
in
their
fortsalma


but
he
kept
his
men
round
about
as
if
making
preparations
forwar
yea
and
truly
he
was
preparing
to
defend
himself
againstthem
by
casting
up
walls
round
about
and
preparing
places
ofresortalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
kept
thus
preparing
for
war
untilmoroni
had
sent
a
large
number
of
men
to
strengthen
his
armyalma


and
moroni
also
sent
orders
unto
him
that
he
should
retain
allthe
prisoners
who
fell
into
his
hands
for
as
the
lamanites
hadtaken
many
prisoners
that
he
should
retain
all
the
prisoners
ofthe
lamanites
as
a
ransom
for
those
whom
the
lamanites
had
takenalma


and
he
also
sent
orders
unto
him
that
he
should
fortify
theland
bountiful
and
secure
the
narrow
pass
which
led
into
theland
northward
lest
the
lamanites
should
obtain
that
point
andshould
have
power
to
harass
them
on
every
sidealma


and
moroni
also
sent
unto
him
desiring
him
that
he
would
befaithful
in
maintaining
that
quarter
of
the
land
and
that
hewould
seek
every
opportunity
to
scourge
the
lamanites
in
thatquarter
as
much
as
was
in
his
power
that
perhaps
he
might
takeagain
by
stratagem
or
some
other
way
those
cities
which
had
beentaken
out
of
their
hands
and
that
he
also
would
fortify
andstrengthen
the
cities
round
about
which
had
not
fallen
into
thehands
of
the
lamanitesalma


and
he
also
said
unto
him
I
would
come
unto
you
but
beholdthe
lamanites
are
upon
us
in
the
borders
of
the
land
by
the
westsea
and
behold
I
go
against
them
therefore
I
cannot
come
untoyoualma


now
the
king
ammoron
had
departed
out
of
the
land
ofzarahemla
and
had
made
known
unto
the
queen
concerning
the
deathof
his
brother
and
had
gathered
together
a
large
number
of
menand
had
marched
forth
against
the
nephites
on
the
borders
by
thewest
seaalma


and
thus
he
was
endeavoring
to
harass
the
nephites
and
todraw
away
a
part
of
their
forces
to
that
part
of
the
land
whilehe
had
commanded
those
whom
he
had
left
to
possess
the
citieswhich
he
had
taken
that
they
should
also
harass
the
nephites
onthe
borders
by
the
east
sea
and
should
take
possession
of
theirlands
as
much
as
it
was
in
their
power
according
to
the
power
oftheir
armiesalma


and
thus
were
the
nephites
in
those
dangerous
circumstancesin
the
ending
of
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudges
over
the
people
of
nephialma


but
behold
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
ofthe
reign
of
the
judges
that
teancum
by
the
command
ofmoroniwho
had
established
armies
to
protect
the
south
and
thewest
borders
of
the
land
and
had
begun
his
march
towards
theland
bountiful
that
he
might
assist
teancum
with
his
men
inretaking
the
cities
which
they
had
lostalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
teancum
had
received
orders
to
makean
attack
upon
the
city
of
mulek
and
retake
it
if
it
werepossiblealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
teancum
made
preparations
to
make
anattack
upon
the
city
of
mulek
and
march
forth
with
his
armyagainst
the
lamanites
but
he
saw
that
it
was
impossible
that
hecould
overpower
them
while
they
were
in
their
fortificationstherefore
he
abandoned
his
designs
and
returned
again
to
the
citybountiful
to
wait
for
the
coming
of
moroni
that
he
mightreceive
strength
to
his
armyalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
did
arrive
with
his
army
atthe
land
of
bountiful
in
the
latter
end
of
the
twenty
andseventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephialma


and
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
moroniand
teancum
and
many
of
the
chief
captains
held
a
council
ofwarwhat
they
should
do
to
cause
the
lamanites
to
come
outagainst
them
to
battle
or
that
they
might
by
some
means
flatterthem
out
of
their
strongholds
that
they
might
gain
advantageover
them
and
take
again
the
city
of
mulekalma


and
it
came
to
pass
they
sent
embassies
to
the
army
of
thelamanites
which
protected
the
city
of
mulek
to
their
leaderwhose
name
was
jacob
desiring
him
that
he
would
come
out
withhis
armies
to
meet
them
upon
the
plains
between
the
two
cities
but
behold
jacob
who
was
a
zoramite
would
not
come
out
withhis
army
to
meet
them
upon
the
plainsalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
having
no
hopes
of
meetingthem
upon
fair
grounds
therefore
he
resolved
upon
a
plan
thathe
might
decoy
the
lamanites
out
of
their
strongholdsalma


therefore
he
caused
that
teancum
should
take
a
small
numberof
men
and
march
down
near
the
seashore
and
moroni
and
his
armyby
night
marched
in
the
wilderness
on
the
west
of
the
citymulek
and
thus
on
the
morrow
when
the
guards
of
the
lamaniteshad
discovered
teancum
they
ran
and
told
it
unto
jacob
theirleaderalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
didmarch
forth
against
teancum
supposing
by
their
numbers
tooverpower
teancum
because
of
the
smallness
of
his
numbers

andas
teancum
saw
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
coming
out
against
himhe
began
to
retreat
down
by
the
seashore
northwardalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
he
beganto
flee
they
took
courage
and
pursued
them
with
vigor

andwhile
teancum
was
thus
leading
away
the
lamanites
who
werepursuing
them
in
vain
behold
moroni
commanded
that
a
part
ofhis
army
who
were
with
him
should
march
forth
into
the
city
andtake
possession
of
italma


and
thus
they
did
and
slew
all
those
who
had
been
left
toprotect
the
city
yea
all
those
who
would
not
yield
up
theirweapons
of
waralma


and
thus
moroni
had
obtained
possession
of
the
city
mulekwith
a
part
of
his
army
while
he
marched
with
the
remainder
tomeet
the
lamanites
when
they
should
return
from
the
pursuit
ofteancumalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
pursue
teancumuntil
they
came
near
the
city
bountiful
and
then
they
were
metby
lehi
and
a
small
army
which
had
been
left
to
protect
the
citybountifulalma


and
now
behold
when
the
chief
captains
of
the
lamanites
hadbeheld
lehi
with
his
army
coming
against
them
they
fled
in
muchconfusion
lest
perhaps
they
should
not
obtain
the
city
mulekbefore
lehi
should
overtake
them
for
they
were
wearied
becauseof
their
march
and
the
men
of
lehi
were
freshalma


now
the
lamanites
did
not
know
that
moroni
had
been
in
theirrear
with
his
army
and
all
they
feared
was
lehi
and
his
menalma


now
lehi
was
not
desirous
to
overtake
them
till
they
shouldmeet
moroni
and
his
armyalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
before
the
lamanites
had
retreatedfar
they
were
surrounded
by
the
nephites
by
the
men
of
moroni
onone
hand
and
the
men
of
lehi
on
the
other
all
of
whom
werefresh
and
full
of
strength
but
the
lamanites
were
weariedbecause
of
their
long
marchalma


and
moroni
commanded
his
men
that
they
should
fall
upon
themuntil
they
had
given
up
their
weapons
of
waralma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
jacob
being
their
leader
beingalso
a
zoramite
and
having
an
unconquerable
spirit
he
led
thelamanites
forth
to
battle
with
exceeding
fury
against
moronialma


moroni
being
in
their
course
of
march
therefore
jacob
wasdetermined
to
slay
them
and
cut
his
way
through
to
the
city
ofmulek

but
behold
moroni
and
his
men
were
more
powerfultherefore
they
did
not
give
way
before
the
lamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fought
on
both
hands
withexceeding
fury
and
there
were
many
slain
on
both
sides
yea
andmoroni
was
wounded
and
jacob
was
killedalma


and
lehi
pressed
upon
their
rear
with
such
fury
with
hisstrong
men
that
the
lamanites
in
the
rear
delivered
up
theirweapons
of
war
and
the
remainder
of
them
being
much
confusedknew
not
whither
to
go
or
to
strikealma


now
moroni
seeing
their
confusion
he
said
unto
them
If
yewill
bring
forth
your
weapons
of
war
and
deliver
them
up
beholdwe
will
forbear
shedding
your
bloodalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
had
heard
thesewords
their
chief
captains
all
those
who
were
not
slain
cameforth
and
threw
down
their
weapons
of
war
at
the
feet
of
moroniand
also
commanded
their
men
that
they
should
do
the
samealma


but
behold
there
were
many
that
would
not
and
those
whowould
not
deliver
up
their
swords
were
taken
and
bound
and
theirweapons
of
war
were
taken
from
them
and
they
were
compelled
tomarch
with
their
brethren
forth
into
the
land
bountifulalma


and
now
the
number
of
prisoners
who
were
taken
exceeded
morethan
the
number
of
those
who
had
been
slain
yea
more
than
thosewho
had
been
slain
on
both
sidesalma
chapter
alma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
set
guards
over
theprisoners
of
the
lamanites
and
did
compel
them
to
go
forth
andbury
their
dead
yea
and
also
the
dead
of
the
nephites
who
wereslain
and
moroni
placed
men
over
them
to
guard
them
while
theyshould
perform
their
laborsalma


and
moroni
went
to
the
city
of
mulek
with
lehi
and
tookcommand
of
the
city
and
gave
it
unto
lehi

now
behold
this
lehiwas
a
man
who
had
been
with
moroni
in
the
more
part
of
all
hisbattles
and
he
was
a
man
like
unto
moroni
and
they
rejoiced
ineach
others
safety
yea
they
were
beloved
by
each
other
andalso
beloved
by
all
the
people
of
nephialma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
lamanites
had
finishedburying
their
dead
and
also
the
dead
of
the
nephites
they
weremarched
back
into
the
land
bountiful
and
teancum
by
the
ordersof
moroni
caused
that
they
should
commence
laboring
in
digging
aditch
round
about
the
land
or
the
city
bountifulalma


and
he
caused
that
they
should
build
a
breastwork
of
timbersupon
the
inner
bank
of
the
ditch
and
they
cast
up
dirt
out
ofthe
ditch
against
the
breastwork
of
timbers
and
thus
they
didcause
the
lamanites
to
labor
until
they
had
encircled
the
city
ofbountiful
round
about
with
a
strong
wall
of
timbers
and
earth
toan
exceeding
heightalma


and
this
city
became
an
exceeding
stronghold
ever
after
andin
this
city
they
did
guard
the
prisoners
of
the
lamanites
yeaeven
within
a
wall
which
they
had
caused
them
to
build
with
theirown
hands

now
moroni
was
compelled
to
cause
the
lamanites
tolabor
because
it
was
easy
to
guard
them
while
at
their
laborand
he
desired
all
his
forces
when
he
should
make
an
attack
uponthe
lamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
had
thus
gained
a
victory
overone
of
the
greatest
of
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
and
hadobtained
possession
of
the
city
of
mulek
which
was
one
of
thestrongest
holds
of
the
lamanites
in
the
land
of
nephi
and
thushe
had
also
built
a
stronghold
to
retain
his
prisonersalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
no
more
attempt
a
battle
withthe
lamanites
in
that
year
but
he
did
employ
his
men
inpreparing
for
war
yea
and
in
making
fortifications
to
guardagainst
the
lamanites
yea
and
also
delivering
their
women
andtheir
children
from
famine
and
affliction
and
providing
food
fortheir
armiesalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
onthe
west
sea
south
while
in
the
absence
of
moroni
on
account
ofsome
intrigue
amongst
the
nephites
which
caused
dissensionsamongst
them
had
gained
some
ground
over
the
nephites
yeainsomuch
that
they
had
obtained
possession
of
a
number
of
theircities
in
that
part
of
the
landalma


and
thus
because
of
iniquity
amongst
themselves
yea
becauseof
dissensions
and
intrigue
among
themselves
they
were
placed
inthe
most
dangerous
circumstancesalma


and
now
behold
I
have
somewhat
to
say
concerning
the
peopleof
ammon
who
in
the
beginning
were
lamanites
but
by
ammon
andhis
brethren
or
rather
by
the
power
and
word
of
god
they
hadbeen
converted
unto
the
lord
and
they
had
been
brought
down
intothe
land
of
zarahemla
and
had
ever
since
been
protected
by
thenephitesalma


and
because
of
their
oath
they
had
been
kept
from
taking
uparms
against
their
brethren
for
they
had
taken
an
oath
that
theynever
would
shed
blood
more
and
according
to
their
oath
theywould
have
perished
yea
they
would
have
suffered
themselves
tohave
fallen
into
the
hands
of
their
brethren
had
it
not
been
forthe
pity
and
the
exceeding
love
which
ammon
and
his
brethren
hadhad
for
themalma


and
for
this
cause
they
were
brought
down
into
the
land
ofzarahemla
and
they
ever
had
been
protected
by
the
nephitesalma


but
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
saw
the
danger
and
themany
afflictions
and
tribulations
which
the
nephites
bore
forthem
they
were
moved
with
compassion
and
were
desirous
to
takeup
arms
in
the
defence
of
their
countryalma


but
behold
as
they
were
about
to
take
their
weapons
of
warthey
were
overpowered
by
the
persuasions
of
helaman
and
hisbrethren
for
they
were
about
to
break
the
oath
which
they
hadmadealma


and
helaman
feared
lest
by
so
doing
they
should
lose
theirsouls
therefore
all
those
who
had
entered
into
this
covenantwere
compelled
to
behold
their
brethren
wade
through
theirafflictions
in
their
dangerous
circumstances
at
this
timealma


but
behold
it
came
to
pass
they
had
many
sons
who
had
notentered
into
a
covenant
that
they
would
not
take
their
weapons
ofwar
to
defend
themselves
against
their
enemies
therefore
theydid
assemble
themselves
together
at
this
time
as
many
as
wereable
to
take
up
arms
and
they
called
themselves
nephitesalma


and
they
entered
into
a
covenant
to
fight
for
the
liberty
ofthe
nephites
yea
to
protect
the
land
unto
the
laying
down
oftheir
lives
yea
even
they
covenanted
that
they
never
would
giveup
their
liberty
but
they
would
fight
in
all
cases
to
protectthe
nephites
and
themselves
from
bondagealma


now
behold
there
were
two
thousand
of
those
young
men
whoentered
into
this
covenant
and
took
their
weapons
of
war
todefend
their
countryalma


and
now
behold
as
they
never
had
hitherto
been
adisadvantage
to
the
nephites
they
became
now
at
this
period
oftime
also
a
great
support
for
they
took
their
weapons
of
warand
they
would
that
helaman
should
be
their
leaderalma


and
they
were
all
young
men
and
they
were
exceedinglyvaliant
for
courage
and
also
for
strength
and
activity
butbehold
this
was
not
allthey
were
men
who
were
true
at
alltimes
in
whatsoever
thing
they
were
entrustedalma


yea
they
were
men
of
truth
and
soberness
for
they
had
beentaught
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
to
walk
uprightlybefore
himalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
helaman
did
march
at
the
head
ofhis
two
thousand
stripling
soldiers
to
the
support
of
the
peoplein
the
borders
of
the
land
on
the
south
by
the
west
seaalma


and
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudges
over
the
people
of
nephialma
chapter
alma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
andninth
year
of
the
judges
that
ammoron
sent
unto
moroni
desiringthat
he
would
exchange
prisonersalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
felt
to
rejoice
exceedingly
atthis
request
for
he
desired
the
provisions
which
were
impartedfor
the
support
of
the
lamanite
prisoners
for
the
support
of
hisown
people
and
he
also
desired
his
own
people
for
thestrengthening
of
his
armyalma


now
the
lamanites
had
taken
many
women
and
children
and
therewas
not
a
woman
nor
a
child
among
all
the
prisoners
of
moroni
orthe
prisoners
whom
moroni
had
taken
therefore
moroni
resolvedupon
a
stratagem
to
obtain
as
many

therefore
he

who
had
brought
an

now
I
close
my
epistle

I
am
moroni
I
am
a
leader
of
thepeople
of
the
nephitesalma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
ammoron
when
he
had
received
thisepistle
was
angry
and
he
wrote
another
epistle
unto
moroni
andthese
are
the
words
which
he
wrote
sayingalma


I
am
ammoron
the
king
of
the
lamanites
I
am
the
brother
ofamalickiah
whom
ye
have
murdered

behold
I
will
avenge
hisblood
upon
you
yea
and
I
will
come
upon
you
with
my
armies
forI
fear
not
your
threateningsalma


for
behold
your
fathers
did
wrong
their
brethren
insomuchthat
they
did
rob
them
of
their
right
to
the
government
when
itrightly
belonged
unto
themalma


and
now
behold
if
ye
will
lay
down
your
arms
and
subjectyourselves
to
be
governed
by
those
to
whom
the
government
dothrightly
belong
then
will
I
cause
that
my
people
shall
lay
downtheir
weapons
and
shall
be
at
war
no
morealma


behold
ye
have
breathed
out
many
threatenings
against
me
andmy
people
but
behold
we
fear
not
your
threateningsalma


nevertheless
I
will
grant
to
exchange
prisoners
according
toyour
request
gladly
that
I
may
preserve
my
food
for
my
men
ofwar
and
we
will
wage
a
war
which
shall
be
eternal
either
to
thesubjecting
the
nephites
to
our
authority
or
to
their
eternalextinctionalma


and
as
concerning
that
god
whom
ye
say
we
have
rejectedbehold
we
know
not
such
a
being
neither
do
ye
but
if
it
so
bethat
there
is
such
a
thing
we
know
not
but
that
he
hath
made
usas
well
as
youalma


and
if
it
so
be
that
there
is
a
devil
and
a
hell
behold
willhe
not
send
you
there
to
dwell
with
my
brother
whom
ye
havemurdered
whom
ye
have
hinted
that
he
hath
gone
to
such
a
place
but
behold
these
things
matter
notalma


I
am
ammoron
and
a
descendant
of
zoram
whom
your
fatherspressed
and
brought
out
of
jerusalemalma


and
behold
now
I
am
a
bold
lamanite
behold
this
war
hathbeen
waged
to
avenge
their
wrongs
and
to
maintain
and
to
obtaintheir
rights
to
the
government
and
I
close
my
epistle
to
moronialma
chapter
alma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
had
received
this
epistlehe
was
more
angry
because
he
knew
that
ammoron
had
a
perfectknowledge
of
his
fraud
yea
he
knew
that
ammoron
knew
that
itwas
not
a
just
cause
that
had
caused
him
to
wage
a
war
againstthe
people
of
nephialma


and
he
said
behold
I
will
not
exchange
prisoners
withammoron
save
he
will
withdraw
his
purpose
as
I
have
stated
in
myepistle
for
I
will
not
grant
unto
him
that
he
shall
have
anymore
power
than
what
he
hath
gotalma


behold
I
know
the
place
where
the
lamanites
do
guard
mypeople
whom
they
have
taken
prisoners
and
as
ammoron
would
notgrant
unto
me
mine
epistle
behold
I
will
give
unto
himaccording
to
my
words
yea
I
will
seek
death
among
them
untilthey
shall
sue
for
peacealma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
had
said
these
wordshe
caused
that
a
search
should
be
made
among
his
men
thatperhaps
he
might
find
a
man
who
was
a
descendant
of
laman
amongthemalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
found
one
whose
name
was
lamanand
he
was
one
of
the
servants
of
the
king
who
was
murdered
byamalickiahalma


now
moroni
caused
that
laman
and
a
small
number
of
his
menshould
go
forth
unto
the
guards
who
were
over
the
nephitesalma


now
the
nephites
were
guarded
in
the
city
of
gid
thereforemoroni
appointed
laman
and
caused
that
a
small
number
of
menshould
go
with
himalma


and
when
it
was
evening
laman
went
to
the
guards
who
were
overthe
nephites
and
behold
they
saw
him
coming
and
they
hailedhim
but
he
saith
unto
them
fear
not
behold
I
am
a
lamanite
behold
we
have
escaped
from
the
nephites
and
they
sleep
andbehold
we
have
taken
of
their
wine
and
brought
with
usalma


now
when
the
lamanites
heard
these
words
they
received
himwith
joy
and
they
said
unto
him
give
us
of
your
wine
that
wemay
drink
we
are
glad
that
ye
have
thus
taken
wine
with
you
forwe
are
wearyalma


but
laman
said
unto
them
let
us
keep
of
our
wine
till
we
goagainst
the
nephites
to
battle

but
this
saying
only
made
themmore
desirous
to
drink
of
the
winealma


for
said
they
we
are
weary
therefore
let
us
take
of
thewine
and
by
and
by
we
shall
receive
wine
for
our
rations
whichwill
strengthen
us
to
go
against
the
nephitesalma


and
laman
said
unto
them
you
may
do
according
to
yourdesiresalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
take
of
the
wine
freelyand
it
was
pleasant
to
their
taste
therefore
they
took
of
itmore
freely
and
it
was
strong
having
been
prepared
in
itsstrengthalma


and
it
came
to
pass
they
did
drink
and
were
merry
and
by
andby
they
were
all
drunkenalma


and
now
when
laman
and
his
men
saw
that
they
were
alldrunken
and
were
in
a
deep
sleep
they
returned
to
moroni
andtold
him
all
the
things
that
had
happenedalma


and
now
this
was
according
to
the
design
of
moroni

andmoroni
had
prepared
his
men
with
weapons
of
war
and
he
went
tothe
city
gid
while
the
lamanites
were
in
a
deep
sleep
anddrunken
and
cast
in
weapons
of
war
unto
the
prisoners
insomuchthat
they
were
all
armedalma


yea
even
to
their
women
and
all
those
of
their
children
asmany
as
were
able
to
use
a
weapon
of
war
when
moroni
had
armedall
those
prisoners
and
all
those
things
were
done
in
a
profoundsilencealma


but
had
they
awakened
the
lamanites
behold
they
were
drunkenand
the
nephites
could
have
slain
themalma


but
behold
this
was
not
the
desire
of
moroni
he
did
notdelight
in
murder
or
bloodshed
but
he
delighted
in
the
saving
ofhis
people
from
destruction
and
for
this
cause
he
might
notbring
upon
him
injustice
he
would
not
fall
upon
the
lamanitesand
destroy
them
in
their
drunkennessalma


but
he
had
obtained
his
desires
for
he
had
armed
thoseprisoners
of
the
nephites
who
were
within
the
wall
of
the
cityand
had
given
them
power
to
gain
possession
of
those
parts
whichwere
within
the
wallsalma


and
then
he
caused
the
men
who
were
with
him
to
withdraw
apace
from
them
and
surround
the
armies
of
the
lamanitesalma


now
behold
this
was
done
in
the
nighttime
so
that
when
thelamanites
awoke
in
the
morning
they
beheld
that
they
weresurrounded
by
the
nephites
without
and
that
their
prisoners
werearmed
withinalma


and
thus
they
saw
that
the
nephites
had
power
over
them
andin
these
circumstances
they
found
that
it
was
not
expedient
thatthey
should
fight
with
the
nephites
therefore
their
chiefcaptains
demanded
their
weapons
of
war
and
they
brought
themforth
and
cast
them
at
the
feet
of
the
nephites
pleading
formercyalma


now
behold
this
was
the
desire
of
moroni

he
took
themprisoners
of
war
and
took
possession
of
the
city
and
causedthat
all
the
prisoners
should
be
liberated
who
were
nephitesand
they
did
join
the
army
of
moroni
and
were
a
great
strengthto
his
armyalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
cause
the
lamanites
whom
hehad
taken
prisoners
that
they
should
commence
a
labor
instrengthening
the
fortifications
round
about
the
city
gidalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
fortified
the
city
gidaccording
to
his
desires
he
caused
that
his
prisoners
should
betaken
to
the
city
bountiful
and
he
also
guarded
that
city
withan
exceedingly
strong
forcealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
notwithstanding
all
theintrigues
of
the
lamanites
keep
and
protect
all
the
prisonerswhom
they
had
taken
and
also
maintain
all
the
ground
and
theadvantage
which
they
had
retakenalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
began
again
to
bevictorious
and
to
reclaim
their
rights
and
their
privilegesalma


many
time
did
the
lamanites
attempt
to
encircle
them
about
bynight
but
in
these
attempts
they
did
lose
many
prisonersalma


and
many
times
did
they
attempt
to
administer
of
their
wineto
the
nephites
that
they
might
destroy
them
with
poison
or
withdrunkennessalma


but
behold
the
nephites
were
not
slow
to
remember
the
lordtheir
god
in
this
their
time
of
affliction

they
could
not
betaken
in
their
snares
yea
they
would
not
partake
of
their
winesave
they
had
first
given
to
some
of
the
lamanite
prisonersalma


and
they
were
thus
cautious
that
no
poison
should
beadministered
among
them
for
if
their
wine
would
poison
alamanite
it
would
also
poison
a
nephite
and
thus
they
did
tryall
their
liquorsalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
expedient
for
moroni
tomake
preparations
to
attack
the
city
morianton
for
behold
thelamanites
had
by
their
labors
fortified
the
city
moriantonuntil
it
had
become
an
exceeding
strongholdalma


and
they
were
continually
bringing
new
forces
into
that
cityand
also
new
supplies
of
provisionsalma


and
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudges
over
the
people
of
nephialma
chapter
alma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
thirtiethyear
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
on
the
second
day
in
the
firstmonth
moroni
received
an
epistle
from
helaman
stating
theaffairs
of
the
people
in
that
quarter
of
the
landalma


and
these
are
the
words
which
he
wrote
saying
my
dearlybeloved
brother
moroni
as
well
in
the
lord
as
in
thetribulations
of
our
warfare
behold
my
beloved
brother
I
havesomewhat
to
tell
you
concerning
our
warfare
in
this
part
of
thelandalma


behold
two
thousand
of
the
sons
of
those
men
whom
ammonbrought
down
out
of
the
land
of
nephinow
ye
have
known
thatthese
were
descendants
of
laman
who
was
the
eldest
son
of
ourfather
lehialma


now
I
need
not
rehearse
unto
you
concerning
their
traditionsor
their
unbelief
for
thou
knowest
concerning
all
these
thingsalma


therefore
it
sufficeth
me
that
I
tell
you
that
two
thousand
ofthese
young
men
have
taken
their
weapons
of
war
and
would
that
Ishould
be
their
leader
and
we
have
come
forth
to
defend
ourcountryalma


and
now
ye
also
know
concerning
the
covenant
which
theirfathers
made
that
they
would
not
take
up
their
weapons
of
waragainst
their
brethren
to
shed
bloodalma


but
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
when
they
saw
ourafflictions
and
our
tribulations
for
them
they
were
about
tobreak
the
covenant
which
they
had
made
and
take
up
their
weaponsof
war
in
our
defencealma


but
I
would
not
suffer
them
that
they
should
break
thiscovenant
which
they
had
made
supposing
that
god
would
strengthenus
insomuch
that
we
should
not
suffer
more
because
of
thefulfilling
the
oath
which
they
had
takenalma


but
behold
here
is
one
thing
in
which
we
may
have
great
joy
for
behold
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
I
helaman
did
marchat
the
head
of
these
two
thousand
young
men
to
the
city
of
judeato
assist
antipus
whom
ye
had
appointed
a
leader
over
the
peopleof
that
part
of
the
landalma


and
I
did
join
my
two
thousand
sons
for
they
are
worthy
tobe
called
sons
to
the
army
of
antipus
in
which
strength
antipusdid
rejoice
exceedingly
for
behold
his
army
had
been
reduced
bythe
lamanites
because
their
forces
had
slain
a
vast
number
of
ourmen
for
which
cause
we
have
to
mournalma


nevertheless
we
may
console
ourselves
in
this
point
thatthey
have
died
in
the
cause
of
their
country
and
of
their
godyea
and
they
are
happyalma


and
the
lamanites
had
also
retained
many
prisoners
all
ofwhom
are
chief
captains
for
none
other
have
they
spared
alive
and
we
suppose
that
they
are
now
at
this
time
in
the
land
ofnephi
it
is
so
if
they
are
not
slainalma


and
now
these
are
the
cities
of
which
the
lamanites
haveobtained
possession
by
the
shedding
of
the
blood
of
so
many
ofour
valiant
menalma


the
land
of
manti
or
the
city
of
manti
and
the
city
ofzeezrom
and
the
city
of
cumeni
and
the
city
of
antiparahalma


and
these
are
the
cities
which
they
possessed
when
I
arrivedat
the
city
of
judea
and
I
found
antipus
and
his
men
toilingwith
their
might
to
fortify
the
cityalma


yea
and
they
were
depressed
in
body
as
well
as
in
spiritfor
they
had
fought
valiantly
by
day
and
toiled
by
night
tomaintain
their
cities
and
thus
they
had
suffered
greatafflictions
of
every
kindalma


and
now
they
were
determined
to
conquer
in
this
place
or
dietherefore
you
may
well
suppose
that
this
little
force
which
Ibrought
with
me
yea
those
sons
of
mine
gave
them
great
hopesand
much
joyalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
saw
thatantipus
had
received
a
greater
strength
to
his
army
they
werecompelled
by
the
orders
of
ammoron
to
not
come
against
the
cityof
judea
or
against
us
to
battlealma


and
thus
were
we
favored
of
the
lord
for
had
they
come
uponus
in
this
our
weakness
they
might
have
perhaps
destroyed
ourlittle
army
but
thus
were
we
preservedalma


they
were
commanded
by
ammoron
to
maintain
those
cities
whichthey
had
taken

and
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
sixth
year

andin
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
we
hadprepared
our
city
and
ourselves
for
defencealma


now
we
were
desirous
that
the
lamanites
should
come
upon
usfor
we
were
not
desirous
to
make
an
attack
upon
them
in
theirstrongholdsalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
kept
spies
out
round
about
towatch
the
movements
of
the
lamanites
that
they
might
not
pass
usby
night
nor
by
day
to
make
an
attack
upon
our
other
cities
whichwere
on
the
northwardalma


for
we
knew
in
those
cities
they
were
not
sufficiently
strongto
meet
them
therefore
we
were
desirous
if
they
should
pass
byus
to
fall
upon
them
in
their
rear
and
thus
bring
them
up
inthe
rear
at
the
same
time
they
were
met
in
the
front

wesupposed
that
we
could
overpower
them
but
behold
we
weredisappointed
in
this
our
desirealma


they
durst
not
pass
by
us
with
their
whole
army
neitherdurst
they
with
a
part
lest
they
should
not
be
sufficientlystrong
and
they
should
fallalma


neither
durst
they
march
down
against
the
city
of
zarahemlaneither
durst
they
cross
the
head
of
sidon
over
to
the
city
ofnephihahalma


and
thus
with
their
forces
they
were
determined
to
maintainthose
cities
which
they
had
takenalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
second
month
of
this
yearthere
was
brought
unto
us
many
provisions
from
the
fathers
ofthose
my
two
thousand
sonsalma


and
also
there
were
sent
two
thousand
men
unto
us
from
theland
of
zarahemla

and
thus
we
were
prepared
with
ten
thousandmen
and
provisions
for
them
and
also
for
their
wives
and
theirchildrenalma


and
the
lamanites
thus
seeing
our
forces
increase
daily
andprovisions
arrive
for
our
support
they
began
to
be
fearful
andbegan
to
sally
forth
if
it
were
possible
to
put
an
end
to
ourreceiving
provisions
and
strengthalma


now
when
we
saw
that
the
lamanites
began
to
grow
uneasy
onthis
wise
we
were
desirous
to
bring
a
stratagem
into
effect
uponthem
therefore
antipus
ordered
that
I
should
march
forth
with
mylittle
sons
to
a
neighboring
city
as
if
we
were
carryingprovisions
to
a
neighboring
cityalma


and
we
were
to
march
near
the
city
of
antiparah
as
if
wewere
going
to
the
city
beyond
in
the
borders
by
the
seashorealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
march
forth
as
if
with
ourprovisions
to
go
to
that
cityalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
antipus
did
march
forth
with
a
partof
his
army
leaving
the
remainder
to
maintain
the
city

but
hedid
not
march
forth
until
I
had
gone
forth
with
my
little
armyand
came
near
the
city
antiparahalma


and
now
in
the
city
antiparah
were
stationed
the
strongestarmy
of
the
lamanites
yea
the
most
numerousalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
been
informed
by
theirspies
they
came
forth
with
their
army
and
marched
against
usalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
flee
before
them
northward
and
thus
we
did
lead
away
the
most
powerful
army
of
thelamanitesalma


yea
even
to
a
considerable
distance
insomuch
that
when
theysaw
the
army
of
antipus
pursuing
them
with
their
might
they
didnot
turn
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
but
pursued
their
march
ina
straight
course
after
us
and
as
we
suppose
it
was
theirintent
to
slay
us
before
antipus
should
overtake
them
and
thisthat
they
might
not
be
surrounded
by
our
peoplealma


and
now
antipus
beholding
our
danger
did
speed
the
march
ofhis
army

but
behold
it
was
night
therefore
they
did
notovertake
us
neither
did
antipus
overtake
them
therefore
we
didcamp
for
the
nightalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
before
the
dawn
of
the
morningbehold
the
lamanites
were
pursuing
us

now
we
were
notsufficiently
strong
to
contend
with
them
yea
I
would
not
sufferthat
my
little
sons
should
fall
into
their
hands
therefore
wedid
continue
our
march
and
we
took
our
march
into
thewildernessalma


now
they
durst
not
turn
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
lestthey
should
be
surrounded
neither
would
I
turn
to
the
right
norto
the
left
lest
they
should
overtake
me
and
we
could
not
standagainst
them
but
be
slain
and
they
would
make
their
escape
andthus
we
did
flee
all
that
day
into
the
wilderness
even
until
itwas
darkalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
again
when
the
light
of
the
morningcame
we
saw
the
lamanites
upon
us
and
we
did
flee
before
themalma


but
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
not
pursue
us
far
beforethey
halted
and
it
was
in
the
morning
of
the
third
day
of
theseventh
monthalma


and
now
whether
they
were
overtaken
by
antipus
we
knew
notbut
I
said
unto
my
men
behold
we
know
not
but
they
have
haltedfor
the
purpose
that
we
should
come
against
them
that
they
mightcatch
us
in
their
snarealma


therefore
what
say
ye
my
sons
will
ye
go
against
them
tobattlealma


and
now
I
say
unto
you
my
beloved
brother
moroni
that
neverhad
I
seen
so
great
courage
nay
not
amongst
all
the
nephitesalma


for
as
I
had
ever
called
them
my
sons
for
they
were
all
ofthem
very
young
even
so
they
said
unto
me
father
behold
ourgod
is
with
us
and
he
will
not
suffer
that
we
should
fall
thenlet
us
go
forth
we
would
not
slay
our
brethren
if
they
would
letus
alone
therefore
let
us
go
lest
they
should
overpower
thearmy
of
antipusalma


now
they
never
had
fought
yet
they
did
not
fear
death
andthey
did
think
more
upon
the
liberty
of
their
fathers
than
theydid
upon
their
lives
yea
they
had
been
taught
by
their
mothersthat
if
they
did
not
doubt
god
would
deliver
themalma


and
they
rehearsed
unto
me
the
words
of
their
motherssaying
we
do
not
doubt
our
mothers
knew
italma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
return
with
my
two
thousandagainst
these
lamanites
who
had
pursued
us

and
now
behold
thearmies
of
antipus
had
overtaken
them
and
a
terrible
battle
hadcommencedalma


the
army
of
antipus
being
weary
because
of
their
long
marchin
so
short
a
space
of
time
were
about
to
fall
into
the
hands
ofthe
lamanites
and
had
I
not
returned
with
my
two
thousand
theywould
have
obtained
their
purposealma


for
antipus
had
fallen
by
the
sword
and
many
of
his
leadersbecause
of
their
weariness
which
was
occasioned
by
the
speed
oftheir
marchtherefore
the
men
of
antipus
being
confused
becauseof
the
fall
of
their
leaders
began
to
give
way
before
thelamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
took
courage
andbegan
to
pursue
them
and
thus
were
the
lamanites
pursuing
themwith
great
vigor
when
helaman
came
upon
their
rear
with
his
twothousand
and
began
to
slay
them
exceedingly
insomuch
that
thewhole
army
of
the
lamanites
halted
and
turned
upon
helamanalma


now
when
the
people
of
antipus
saw
that
the
lamanites
hadturned
them
about
they
gathered
together
their
men
and
cameagain
upon
the
rear
of
the
lamanitesalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
we
the
people
of
nephi
thepeople
of
antipus
and
I
with
my
two
thousand
did
surround
thelamanites
and
did
slay
them
yea
insomuch
that
they
werecompelled
to
deliver
up
their
weapons
of
war
and
also
themselvesas
prisoners
of
waralma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
surrenderedthemselves
up
unto
us
behold
I
numbered
those
young
men
who
hadfought
with
me
fearing
lest
there
were
many
of
them
slainalma


but
behold
to
my
great
joy
there
had
not
one
soul
of
themfallen
to
the
earth
yea
and
they
had
fought
as
if
with
thestrength
of
god
yea
never
were
men
known
to
have
fought
withsuch
miraculous
strength
and
with
such
mighty
power
did
theyfall
upon
the
lamanites
that
they
did
frighten
them
and
forthis
cause
did
the
lamanites
deliver
themselves
up
as
prisonersof
waralma


and
as
we
had
no
place
for
our
prisoners
that
we
could
guardthem
to
keep
them
from
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
therefore
wesent
them
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
a
part
of
those
men
whowere
not
slain
of
antipus
with
them
and
the
remainder
I
tookand
joined
them
to
my
stripling
ammonites
and
took
our
marchback
to
the
city
of
judeaalma
chapter
alma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
received
an
epistle
fromammoron
the
king
stating
that
if
I
would
deliver
up
thoseprisoners
of
war
whom
we
had
taken
that
he
would
deliver
up
thecity
of
antiparah
unto
usalma


but
I
sent
an
epistle
unto
the
king
that
we
were
sure
ourforces
were
sufficient
to
take
the
city
of
antiparah
by
ourforce
and
by
delivering
up
the
prisoners
for
that
city
we
shouldsuppose
ourselves
unwise
and
that
we
would
only
deliver
up
ourprisoners
on
exchangealma


and
ammoron
refused
mine
epistle
for
he
would
not
exchangeprisoners
therefore
we
began
to
make
preparations
to
go
againstthe
city
of
antiparahalma


but
the
people
of
antiparah
did
leave
the
city
and
fled
totheir
other
cities
which
they
had
possession
of
to
fortifythem
and
thus
the
city
of
antiparah
fell
into
our
handsalma


and
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudgesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
andninth
year
we
received
a
supply
of
provisions
and
also
anaddition
to
our
army
from
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
from
theland
round
about
to
the
number
of
six
thousand
men
besidessixty
of
the
sons
of
the
ammonites
who
had
come
to
join
theirbrethren
my
little
band
of
two
thousand

and
now
behold
wewere
strong
yea
and
we
had
also
plenty
of
provisions
broughtunto
usalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
our
desire
to
wage
a
battlewith
the
army
which
was
placed
to
protect
the
city
cumenialma


and
now
behold
I
will
show
unto
you
that
we
soon
accomplishedour
desire
yea
with
our
strong
force
or
with
a
part
of
ourstrong
force
we
did
surround
by
night
the
city
cumeni
alittle
before
they
were
to
receive
a
supply
of
provisionsalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
camp
round
about
the
city
formany
nights
but
we
did
sleep
upon
our
swords
and
keep
guardsthat
the
lamanites
could
not
come
upon
us
by
night
and
slay
uswhich
they
attempted
many
times
but
as
many
times
as
theyattempted
this
their
blood
was
spiltalma


at
length
their
provisions
did
arrive
and
they
were
about
toenter
the
city
by
night

and
we
instead
of
being
lamaniteswere
nephites
therefore
we
did
take
them
and
their
provisionsalma


and
notwithstanding
the
lamanites
being
cut
off
from
theirsupport
after
this
manner
they
were
still
determined
to
maintainthe
city
therefore
it
became
expedient
that
we
should
take
thoseprovisions
and
send
them
to
judea
and
our
prisoners
to
the
landof
zarahemlaalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
not
many
days
had
passed
away
beforethe
lamanites
began
to
lose
all
hopes
of
succor
therefore
theyyielded
up
the
city
unto
our
hands
and
thus
we
had
accomplishedour
designs
in
obtaining
the
city
cumenialma


but
it
came
to
pass
that
our
prisoners
were
so
numerous
thatnotwithstanding
the
enormity
of
our
numbers
we
were
obliged
toemploy
all
our
force
to
keep
them
or
to
put
them
to
deathalma


for
behold
they
would
break
out
in
great
numbers
and
wouldfight
with
stones
and
with
clubs
or
whatsoever
thing
they
couldget
into
their
hands
insomuch
that
we
did
slay
upwards
of
twothousand
of
them
after
they
had
surrendered
themselves
prisonersof
waralma


therefore
it
became
expedient
for
us
that
we
should
put
anend
to
their
lives
or
guard
them
sword
in
hand
down
to
theland
of
zarahemla
and
also
our
provisions
were
not
any
more
thansufficient
for
our
own
people
notwithstanding
that
which
we
hadtaken
from
the
lamanitesalma


and
now
in
those
critical
circumstances
it
became
a
veryserious
matter
to
determine
concerning
these
prisoners
of
warnevertheless
we
did
resolve
to
send
them
down
to
the
land
ofzarahemla
therefore
we
selected
a
part
of
our
men
and
gave
themcharge
over
our
prisoners
to
go
down
to
the
land
of
zarahemlaalma


but
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
they
did
return

andnow
behold
we
did
not
inquire
of
them
concerning
the
prisonersfor
behold
the
lamanites
were
upon
us
and
they
returned
inseason
to
save
us
from
falling
into
their
hands

for
beholdammoron
had
sent
to
their
support
a
new
supply
of
provisions
andalso
a
numerous
army
of
menalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
men
whom
we
sent
with
theprisoners
did
arrive
in
season
to
check
them
as
they
were
aboutto
overpower
usalma


but
behold
my
little
band
of
two
thousand
and
sixty
foughtmost
desperately
yea
they
were
firm
before
the
lamanites
anddid
administer
death
unto
all
those
who
opposed
themalma


and
as
the
remainder
of
our
army
were
about
to
give
waybefore
the
lamanites
behold
those
two
thousand
and
sixty
werefirm
and
undauntedalma


yea
and
they
did
obey
and
observe
to
perform
every
word
ofcommand
with
exactness
yea
and
even
according
to
their
faith
itwas
done
unto
them
and
I
did
remember
the
words
which
they
saidunto
me
that
their
mothers
had
taught
themalma


and
now
behold
it
was
these
my
sons
and
those
men
who
hadbeen
selected
to
convey
the
prisoners
to
whom
we
owe
this
greatvictory
for
it
was
they
who
did
beat
the
lamanites
thereforethey
were
driven
back
to
the
city
of
mantialma


and
we
retained
our
city
cumeni
and
were
not
all
destroyedby
the
sword
nevertheless
we
had
suffered
great
lossalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
lamanites
had
fled
Iimmediately
gave
orders
that
my
men
who
had
been
wounded
shouldbe
taken
from
among
the
dead
and
caused
that
their
wounds
shouldbe
dressedalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
two
hundred
out
of
mytwo
thousand
and
sixty
who
had
fainted
because
of
the
loss
ofblood
nevertheless
according
to
the
goodness
of
god
and
to
ourgreat
astonishment
and
also
the
joy
of
our
whole
army
there
wasnot
one
soul
of
them
who
did
perish
yea
and
neither
was
thereone
soul
among
them
who
had
not
received
many
woundsalma


and
now
their
preservation
was
astonishing
to
our
wholearmy
yea
that
they
should
be
spared
while
there
was
a
thousandof
our
brethren
who
were
slain

and
we
do
justly
ascribe
it
tothe
miraculous
power
of
god
because
of
their
exceeding
faith
inthat
which
they
had
been
taught
to
believethat
there
was
a
justgod
and
whosoever
did
not
doubt
that
they
should
be
preservedby
his
marvelous
poweralma


now
this
was
the
faith
of
these
of
whom
I
have
spoken
theyare
young
and
their
minds
are
firm
and
they
do
put
their
trustin
god
continuallyalma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
thus
taken
care
ofour
wounded
men
and
had
buried
our
dead
and
also
the
dead
of
thelamanites
who
were
many
behold
we
did
inquire
of
gidconcerning
the
prisoners
whom
they
had
started
to
go
down
to
theland
of
zarahemla
withalma


now
gid
was
the
chief
captain
over
the
band
who
was
appointedto
guard
them
down
to
the
landalma


and
now
these
are
the
words
which
gid
said
unto
me
beholdwe
did
start
to
go
down
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
with
ourprisoners

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
meet
the
spies
of
ourarmies
who
had
been
sent
out
to
watch
the
camp
of
the
lamanitesalma


and
they
cried
unto
us

the
armies
of

are
marching
towards
the
city
of
cumeni
and
beholdthey
will
fall
upon
them
yea
and
will
destroy
our
peoplealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
our
prisoners
did
hear
their
crieswhich
caused
them
to
take
courage
and
they
did
rise
up
inrebellion
against
usalma


and
it
came
to
pass
because
of
their
rebellion
we
did
causethat
our
swords
should
come
upon
them

and
it
came
to
pass
thatthey
did
in
a
body
run
upon
our
swords
in
the
which
the
greaternumber
of
them
were
slain
and
the
remainder
of
them
brokethrough
and
fled
from
usalma


and
behold
when
they
had
fled
and
we
could
not
overtakethem
we
took
our
march
with
speed
towards
the
city
cumeni
andbehold
we
did
arrive
in
time
that
we
might
assist
our
brethrenin
preserving
the
cityalma


and
behold
we
are
again
delivered
out
of
the
hands
of
ourenemies

and
blessed
is
the
name
of
our
god
for
behold
it
ishe
that
has
delivered
us
yea
that
has
done
this
great
thing
forusalma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
helaman
had
heard
thesewords
of

I
was
filled
with
exceeding
joy
because
of
thegoodness
of
god
in
preserving
us

we
might
not
all
perishyea
and
I
trust
that

chapter
alma


and
behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
our
next
object
was
toobtain
the
city
of
manti
but
behold
there
was
no
way
that
wecould
lead
them
out
of
the
city
by
our
small
bands

for
beholdthey
remembered
that
which
we
had
hitherto
done
therefore
wecould
not
decoy
them
away
from
their
strongholdsalma


and
they
were
so
much
more
numerous
than
was
our
army
that
wedurst
not
go
forth
and
attack
them
in
their
strongholdsalma


yea
and
it
became
expedient
that
we
should
employ
our
men
tothe
maintaining
those
parts
of
the
land
which
we
had
regained
ofour
possessions
therefore
it
became
expedient
that
we
shouldwait
that
we
might
receive
more
strength
from
the
land
ofzarahemla
and
also
a
new
supply
of
provisionsalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
thus
did
send
an
embassy
to
thegovernor
of
our
land
to
acquaint
him
concerning
the
affairs
ofour
people

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
wait
to
receiveprovisions
and
strength
from
the
land
of
zarahemlaalma


but
behold
this
did
profit
us
but
little
for
the
lamaniteswere
also
receiving
great
strength
from
day
to
day
and
also
manyprovisions
and
thus
were
our
circumstances
at
this
period
oftimealma


and
the
lamanites
were
sallying
forth
against
us
from
time
totime
resolving
by
stratagem
to
destroy
us
nevertheless
we
couldnot
come
to
battle
with
them
because
of
their
retreats
and
theirstrongholdsalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
wait
in
these
difficultcircumstances
for
the
space
of
many
months
even
until
we
wereabout
to
perish
for
the
want
of
foodalma


but
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
receive
food
which
wasguarded
to
us
by
an
army
of
two
thousand
men
to
our
assistanceand
this
is
all
the
assistance
which
we
did
receive
to
defendourselves
and
our
country
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
ourenemies
yea
to
contend
with
an
enemy
which
was
innumerablealma


and
now
the
cause
of
these
our
embarrassments
or
the
causewhy
they
did
not
send
more
strength
unto
us
we
knew
nottherefore
we
were
grieved
and
also
filled
with
fear
lest
by
anymeans
the
judgments
of
god
should
come
upon
our
land
to
ouroverthrow
and
utter
destructionalma


therefore
we
did
pour
out
our
souls
in
prayer
to
god
that
hewould
strengthen
us
and
deliver
us
out
of
the
hands
of
ourenemies
yea
and
also
give
us
strength
that
we
might
retain
ourcities
and
our
lands
and
our
possessions
for
the
support
ofour
peoplealma


yea
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
our
god
did
visit
uswith
assurances
that
he
would
deliver
us
yea
insomuch
that
hedid
speak
peace
to
our
souls
and
did
grant
unto
us
great
faithand
did
cause
us
that
we
should
hope
for
our
deliverance
in
himalma


and
we
did
take
courage
with
our
small
force
which
we
hadreceived
and
were
fixed
with
a
determination
to
conquer
ourenemies
and
to
maintain
our
lands
and
our
possessions
and
ourwives
and
our
children
and
the
cause
of
our
libertyalma


and
thus
we
did
go
forth
with
all
our
might
against
thelamanites
who
were
in
the
city
of
manti
and
we
did
pitch
ourtents
by
the
wilderness
side
which
was
near
to
the
cityalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
that
when
thelamanites
saw
that
we
were
in
the
borders
by
the
wilderness
whichwas
near
the
city
that
they
sent
out
their
spies
round
about
usthat
they
might
discover
the
number
and
the
strength
of
our
armyalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
saw
that
we
were
notstrong
according
to
our
numbers
and
fearing
that
we
should
cutthem
off
from
their
support
except
they
should
come
out
to
battleagainst
us
and
kill
us
and
also
supposing
that
they
could
easilydestroy
us
with
their
numerous
hosts
therefore
they
began
tomake
preparations
to
come
out
against
us
to
battlealma


and
when
we
saw
that
they
were
making
preparations
to
comeout
against
us
behold
I
caused
that
gid
with
a
small
number
ofmen
should
secrete
himself
in
the
wilderness
and
also
thatteomner
and
a
small
number
of
men
should
secrete
themselves
alsoin
the
wildernessalma


now
gid
and
his
men
were
on
the
right
and
the
others
on
theleft
and
when
they
had
thus
secreted
themselves
behold
Iremained
with
the
remainder
of
my
army
in
that
same
place
wherewe
had
first
pitched
our
tents
against
the
time
that
thelamanites
should
come
out
to
battlealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
come
out
withtheir
numerous
army
against
us

and
when
they
had
come
and
wereabout
to
fall
upon
us
with
the
sword
I
caused
that
my
men
thosewho
were
with
me
should
retreat
into
the
wildernessalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
follow
after
uswith
great
speed
for
they
were
exceedingly
desirous
to
overtakeus
that
they
might
slay
us
therefore
they
did
follow
us
into
thewilderness
and
we
did
pass
by
in
the
midst
of
gid
and
teomnerinsomuch
that
they
were
not
discovered
by
the
lamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
had
passed
by
orwhen
the
army
had
passed
by
gid
and
teomner
did
rise
up
fromtheir
secret
places
and
did
cut
off
the
spies
of
the
lamanitesthat
they
should
not
return
to
the
cityalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
cut
them
off
they
ranto
the
city
and
fell
upon
the
guards
who
were
left
to
guard
thecity
insomuch
that
they
did
destroy
them
and
did
take
possessionof
the
cityalma


now
this
was
done
because
the
lamanites
did
suffer
theirwhole
army
save
a
few
guards
only
to
be
led
away
into
thewildernessalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
gid
and
teomner
by
this
means
hadobtained
possession
of
their
strongholds

and
it
came
to
passthat
we
took
our
course
after
having
traveled
much
in
thewilderness
towards
the
land
of
zarahemlaalma


and
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
they
were
marching
towardsthe
land
of
zarahemla
they
were
exceedingly
afraid
lest
therewas
a
plan
laid
to
lead
them
on
to
destruction
therefore
theybegan
to
retreat
into
the
wilderness
again
yea
even
back
by
thesame
way
which
they
had
comealma


and
behold
it
was
night
and
they
did
pitch
their
tents
forthe
chief
captains
of
the
lamanites
had
supposed
that
thenephites
were
weary
because
of
their
march
and
supposing
thatthey
had
driven
their
whole
army
therefore
they
took
no
thoughtconcerning
the
city
of
mantialma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
it
was
night
I
caused
that
mymen
should
not
sleep
but
that
they
should
march
forward
byanother
way
towards
the
land
of
mantialma


and
because
of
this
our
march
in
the
nighttime
behold
onthe
morrow
we
were
beyond
the
lamanites
insomuch
that
we
didarrive
before
them
at
the
city
of
mantialma


and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
by
this
stratagem
we
did
takepossession
of
the
city
of
manti
without
the
shedding
of
bloodalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
didarrive
near
the
city
and
saw
that
we
were
prepared
to
meet
themthey
were
astonished
exceedingly
and
struck
with
great
fearinsomuch
that
they
did
flee
into
the
wildernessalma


yea
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
didflee
out
of
all
this
quarter
of
the
land

but
behold
they
havecarried
with
them
many
women
and
children
out
of
the
landalma


and
those
cities
which
had
been
taken
by
the
lamanites
allof
them
are
at
this
period
of
time
in
our
possession
and
ourfathers
and
our
women
and
our
children
are
returning
to
theirhomes
all
save
it
be
those
who
have
been
taken
prisoners
andcarried
off
by
the
lamanitesalma


but
behold
our
armies
are
small
to
maintain
so
great
anumber
of
cities
and
so
great
possessionsalma


but
behold
we
trust
in
our
god
who
has
given
us
victory
overthose
lands
insomuch
that
we
have
obtained
those
cities
andthose
lands
which
were
our
ownalma


now
we
do
not
know
the
cause
that
the
government
does
notgrant
us
more
strength
neither
do
those
men
who
came
up
unto
usknow
why
we
have
not
received
greater
strengthalma


behold
we
do
not
know
but
what
ye
are
unsuccessful
and
yehave
drawn
away
the
forces
into
that
quarter
of
the
land
if
sowe
do
not
desire
to
murmuralma


and
if
it
is
not
so
behold
we
fear
that
there
is
somefaction
in
the
government
that
they
do
not
send
more
men
to
ourassistance
for
we
know
that
they
are
more
numerous
than
thatwhich
they
have
sentalma


but
behold
it
mattereth
notwe
trust
god
will
deliver
usnotwithstanding
the
weakness
of
our
armies
yea
and
deliver
usout
of
the
hands
of
our
enemiesalma


behold
this
is
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
in
the
latter
endand
we
are
in
the
possession
of
our
lands
and
the
lamanites
havefled
to
the
land
of
nephialma


and
those
sons
of
the
people
of
ammon
of
whom
I
have
sohighly
spoken
are
with
me
in
the
city
of
manti
and
the
lord
hadsupported
them
yea
and
kept
them
from
falling
by
the
swordinsomuch
that
even
one
soul
has
not
been
slainalma


but
behold
they
have
received
many
wounds
nevertheless
theystand
fast
in
that
liberty
wherewith
god
has
made
them
free
andthey
are
strict
to
remember
the
lord
their
god
from
day
to
dayyea
they
do
observe
to
keep
his
statutes
and
his
judgments
andhis
commandments
continually
and
their
faith
is
strong
in
theprophecies
concerning
that
which
is
to
comealma


and
now
my
beloved
brother
moroni
may
the
lord
our
godwho
has
redeemed
us
and
made
us
free
keep
you
continually
in
hispresence
yea
and
may
he
favor
this
people
even
that
ye
mayhave
success
in
obtaining
the
possession
of
all
that
which
thelamanites
have
taken
from
us
which
was
for
our
support

andnow
behold
I
close
mine
epistle

I
am
helaman
the
son
ofalmaalma
chapter
alma


now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudges
over
the
people
of
nephi
after
moroni
had
received
andhad
read
helamans
epistle
he
was
exceedingly
rejoiced
becauseof
the
welfare
yea
the
exceeding
success
which
helaman
had
hadin
obtaining
those
lands
which
were
lostalma


yea
and
he
did
make
it
known
unto
all
his
people
in
all
theland
round
about
in
that
part
where
he
was
that
they
mightrejoice
alsoalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
immediately
sent
an
epistle
topahoran
desiring
that
he
should
cause
men
to
be
gatheredtogether
to
strengthen
helaman
or
the
armies
of
helamaninsomuch
that
he
might
with
ease
maintain
that
part
of
the
landwhich
he
had
been
so
miraculously
prospered
in
regainingalma


and
it
came
to
pass
when
moroni
had
sent
this
epistle
to
theland
of
zarahemla
he
began
again
to
lay
a
plan
that
he
mightobtain
the
remainder
of
those
possessions
and
cities
which
thelamanites
had
taken
from
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
moroni
was
thus
makingpreparations
to
go
against
the
lamanites
to
battle
behold
thepeople
of
nephihah
who
were
gathered
together
from
the
city
ofmoroni
and
the
city
of
lehi
and
the
city
of
morianton
wereattacked
by
the
lamanitesalma


yea
even
those
who
had
been
compelled
to
flee
from
the
landof
manti
and
from
the
land
round
about
had
come
over
and
joinedthe
lamanites
in
this
part
of
the
landalma


and
thus
being
exceedingly
numerous
yea
and
receivingstrength
from
day
to
day
by
the
command
of
ammoron
they
cameforth
against
the
people
of
nephihah
and
they
did
begin
to
slaythem
with
an
exceedingly
great
slaughteralma


and
their
armies
were
so
numerous
that
the
remainder
of
thepeople
of
nephihah
were
obliged
to
flee
before
them
and
theycame
even
and
joined
the
army
of
moronialma


and
now
as
moroni
had
supposed
that
there
should
be
men
sentto
the
city
nephihah
to
the
assistance
of
the
people
to
maintainthat
city
and
knowing
that
it
was
easier
to
keep
the
city
fromfalling
into
the
hands
of
the
lamanites
than
to
retake
it
fromthem
he
supposed
that
they
would
easily
maintain
that
cityalma


therefore
he
retained
all
his
force
to
maintain
those
placeswhich
he
had
recoveredalma


and
now
when
moroni
saw
that
the
city
of
nephihah
was
losthe
was
exceedingly
sorrowful
and
began
to
doubt
because
of
thewickedness
of
the
people
whether
they
should
not
fall
into
thehands
of
their
brethrenalma


now
this
was
the
case
with
all
his
chief
captains

theydoubted
and
marveled
also
because
of
the
wickedness
of
thepeople
and
this
because
of
the
success
of
the
lamanites
overthemalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
was
angry
with
thegovernment
because
of
their
indifference
concerning
the
freedomof
their
countryalma
chapter
alma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
wrote
again
to
the
governor
of
theland
who
was
pahoran
and
these
are
the
words
which
he
wrotesaying
behold
I
direct
mine

to

in
the
city
ofzarahemla

is

and
the
governor

landand
also
to
all
those
who
have
been
chosen
by
this
people
togovern
and
manage
the
affairs
of
this
waralma


for
behold
I
have
somewhat
to
say
unto
them
by
the
way
ofcondemnation
for
behold
ye
yourselves
know
that
ye
have
beenappointed
to
gather
together
men
and
arm
them
with
swords
andwith
cimeters
and
all
manner
of
weapons
of
war
of
every
kindand
send
forth
against
the
lamanites
in
whatsoever
parts
theyshould
come
into
our
landalma


and
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
myself
and
also
my
menand
also
helaman
and
his
men
have
suffered
exceedingly
greatsufferings
yea
even
hunger
thirst
and
fatigue
and
all
mannerof
afflictions
of
every
kindalma


but
behold
were
this
all
we
had
suffered

would
not

but
behold
great
has
been
the
slaughter
among
our
peopleyea
thousands
have
fallen
by
the
sword
while
it
might
haveotherwise
been
if
ye
had
rendered
unto
our

succor
for
them

great
has
been
your
neglecttowards
usalma


and
now
behold
we
desire
to
know
the
cause
of
thisexceedingly
great
neglect
yea
we
desire
to
know
the
cause
ofyour
thoughtless
statealma


can
you
think

state
ofthoughtless
stupor

looked
up
to
you
for
protection
yeahave
placed
you
in
a
situation
that
ye
might
have
succored
themyea
ye
might
have
sent
armies
unto
them
to
have
strengthenedthem
and
have
saved
thousands
of
them
from
falling
by
the
swordalma


but
behold
this
is
not
allye
have
withheld
your
provisionsfrom
them
insomuch
that
many
have
fought
and
bled
out
theirlives
because
of
their
great
desires
which
they
had
for
thewelfare
of
this
people
yea
and
this
they
have
done
when
theywere
about
to
perish
with
hunger
because
of
your
exceedinglygreat
neglect
towards
themalma


and
now
my
beloved
brethrenfor
ye
ought
to
be
belovedyea
and
ye
ought
to
have
stirred
yourselves
more
diligently
forthe
welfare
and
the
freedom
of
this
people
but
behold
ye
haveneglected
them
insomuch
that
the
blood
of
thousands
shall
comeupon
your
heads
for
vengeance
yea
for
known
unto
god
were
alltheir
cries
and
all
their
sufferingsalma


behold
could
ye
suppose
that
ye
could
sit
upon
your
thronesand
because
of
the
exceeding
goodness
of
god
ye
could
do
nothingand
he
would
deliver
you

behold
if
ye
have
supposed
this
yehave
supposed
in
vainalma


do
ye
suppose
that
because
so
many
of
your
brethren
havebeen
killed
it
is
because
of
their
wickedness

I
say
unto
youif
ye
have
supposed
this
ye
have
supposed
in
vain
for
I
say
untoyou
there
are
many
who
have
fallen
by
the
sword
and
behold
itis
to
your
condemnationalma


for
the
lord
suffereth
the
righteous
to
be
slain
that
hisjustice
and
judgment
may
come
upon
the
wicked
therefore
ye
neednot
suppose
that
the
righteous
are
lost
because
they
are
slainbut
behold
they
do
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
lord
their
godalma


and
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
I
fear
exceedingly
that
thejudgments
of
god
will
come
upon
this
people
because
of
theirexceeding
slothfulness
yea
even
the
slothfulness
of
ourgovernment
and
their
exceedingly
great
neglect
towards
theirbrethren
yea
towards
those
who
have
been
slainalma


for
were
it
not
for
the
wickedness
which
first
commenced
atour
head
we
could
have
withstood
our
enemies
that
they
couldhave
gained
no
power
over
usalma


yea
had
it
not
been
for
the
war
which
broke
out
amongourselves
yea
were
it
not
for
these
kingmen
who
caused
somuch
bloodshed
among
ourselves
yea
at
the
time
we
werecontending
among
ourselves
if
we
had
united
our
strength
as
wehitherto
have
done
yea
had
it
not
been
for
the
desire
of
powerand
authority
which
those
kingmen
had
over
us
had
they
beentrue
to
the
cause
of
our
freedom
and
united
with
us
and
goneforth
against
our
enemies
instead
of
taking
up
their
swordsagainst
us
which
was
the
cause
of
so
much
bloodshed
amongourselves
yea
if
we
had
gone
forth
against
them
in
the
strengthof
the
lord
we
should
have
dispersed
our
enemies
for
it
wouldhave
been
done
according
to
the
fulfilling
of
his
wordalma


but
behold
now
the
lamanites
are
coming
upon
us
takingpossession
of
our
lands
and
they
are
murdering
our
people
withthe
sword
yea
our
women
and
our
children
and
also
carryingthem
away
captive
causing
them
that
they
should
suffer
allmanner
of
afflictions
and
this
because
of
the
great
wickednessof
those
who
are
seeking
for
power
and
authority
yea
even
thosekingmenalma


but
why
should
I
say
much
concerning
this
matter

for
weknow
not
but
what
ye
yourselves
are
seeking
for
authority

weknow
not
but
what
ye
are
also
traitors
to
your
countryalma


or
is
it
that
ye
have
neglected
us
because
ye
are
in
theheart
of
our
country
and
ye
are
surrounded
by
security
that
yedo
not
cause
food
to
be
sent
unto
us
and
also
men
to
strengthenour
armiesalma


have
ye
forgotten
the
commandments
of
the
lord
your
god
yea
have
ye
forgotten
the
captivity
of
our
fathers

have
yeforgotten
the
many
times
we
have
been
delivered
out
of
the
handsof
our
enemiesalma


or
do
ye
suppose
that
the
lord
will
still
deliver
us
whilewe
sit
upon
our
thrones
and
do
not
make
use
of
the
means
whichthe

are
thousands
round
about
in
the
bordersof
the
land
who
are
falling
by
the
sword

wounded
andbleedingalma


do
ye
suppose
that
god
will
look
upon
you
as
guiltless
whileye
sit
still
and
behold
these
things

behold
I
say
unto
younay

now
I
would
that
ye

remember
that

of

it
will
beexpedient
that
we
contend
no
more
with
the
lamanites
until
wehave
first
cleansed
our
inward
vessel
yea
even
the
great

great
iniquityalma


and
now
moroni
I
do
joy
in
receiving
your
epistle
for
Iwas
somewhat
worried
concerning
what
we
should
do
whether
itshould
be
just
in
us
to
go
against
our
brethrenalma


but
ye
have
said
except
they
repent
the
lord
hath
commandedyou
that
ye
should
go
against
themalma


see
that
ye
strengthen
lehi
and
teancum
in
the
lord

to
fear
not
for
god
will
deliver
them
yea
and
also
allthose
who
stand
fast
in
that
liberty
wherewith
god
hath
made
themfree

and
now
I
close
mine
epistle
to
my
beloved
brothermoronialma
chapter
alma


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
moroni
had
received
thisepistle
his
heart
did
take
courage
and
was
filled
withexceedingly
great
joy
because
of
the
faithfulness
of
pahoranthat
he
was
not
also
a
traitor
to
the
freedom
and
cause
of
hiscountryalma


but
he
did
also
mourn
exceedingly
because
of
the
iniquity
ofthose
who
had
driven
pahoran
from
the
judgmentseat
yea
in
finebecause
of
those
who
had
rebelled
against
their
country
and
alsotheir
godalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
took
a
small
number
of
menaccording
to
the
desire
of
pahoran
and
gave
lehi
and
teancumcommand
over
the
remainder
of
his
army
and
took
his
marchtowards
the
land
of
gideonalma


and
he
did
raise
the
standard
of
liberty
in
whatsoever
placehe
did
enter
and
gained
whatsoever
force
he
could
in
all
hismarch
towards
the
land
of
gideonalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
thousands
did
flock
unto
hisstandard
and
did
take
up
their
swords
in
the
defence
of
theirfreedom
that
they
might
not
come
into
bondagealma


and
thus
when
moroni
had
gathered
together
whatsoever
men
hecould
in
all
his
march
he
came
to
the
land
of
gideon
anduniting
his
forces
with
those
of
pahoran
they
became
exceedinglystrong
even
stronger
than
the
men
of
pachus
who
was
the
king
ofthose
dissenters
who
had
driven
the
freemen
out
of
the
land
ofzarahemla
and
had
taken
possession
of
the
landalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
and
pahoran
went
down
withtheir
armies
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
went
forth
againstthe
city
and
did
meet
the
men
of
pachus
insomuch
that
they
didcome
to
battlealma


and
behold
pachus
was
slain
and
his
men
were
taken
prisonersand
pahoran
was
restored
to
his
judgmentseatalma


and
the
men
of
pachus
received
their
trial
according
to
thelaw
and
also
those
kingmen
who
had
been
taken
and
cast
intoprison
and
they
were
executed
according
to
the
law
yea
thosemen
of
pachus
and
those
kingmen
whosoever
would
not
take
uparms
in
the
defence
of
their
country
but
would
fight
against
itwere
put
to
deathalma


and
thus
it
became
expedient
that
this
law
should
be
strictlyobserved
for
the
safety
of
their
country
yea
and
whosoever
wasfound
denying
their
freedom
was
speedily
executed
according
tothe
lawalma


and
thus
ended
the
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judgesover
the
people
of

moroni

pahoran
having
restoredpeace

death
upon

were
not
true

and
it
came
to
pass
in

an
army
of
six
thousand
men
should
be
sent
unto

and
he
also
caused
that
an
army
of
six
thousand
men
with
asufficient
quantity
of
food
should
be
sent
to
the
armies
of
lehiand
teancum

and
it
came
to
pass
that
this
was
done
to
fortifythe
land
against
the
lamanitesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
and
pahoran
leaving
a
largebody
of
men
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
took
their
march
with
alarge
body
of
men
towards
the
land
of
nephihah
being
determinedto
overthrow
the
lamanites
in
that
cityalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
they
were
marching
towards
theland
they
took
a
large
body
of
men
of
the
lamanites
and
slewmany
of
them
and
took
their
provisions
and
their
weapons
of
waralma


and
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
taken
them
they
causedthem
to
enter
into
a
covenant
that
they
would
no
more
take
uptheir
weapons
of
war
against
the
nephitesalma


and
when
they
had
entered
into
this
covenant
they
sent
themto
dwell
with
the
people
of
ammon
and
they
were
in
number
aboutfour
thousand
who
had
not
been
slainalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
sent
them
away
theypursued
their
march
towards
the
land
of
nephihah

and
it
came
topass
that
when
they
had
come
to
the
city
of
nephihah
they
didpitch
their
tents
in
the
plains
of
nephihah
which
is
near
thecity
of
nephihahalma


now
moroni
was
desirous
that
the
lamanites
should
come
out
tobattle
against
them
upon
the
plains
but
the
lamanites
knowingof
their
exceedingly
great
courage
and
beholding
the
greatnessof
their
numbers
therefore
they
durst
not
come
out
against
themtherefore
they
did
not
come
to
battle
in
that
dayalma


and
when
the
night
came
moroni
went
forth
in
the
darkness
ofthe
night
and
came
upon
the
top
of
the
wall
to
spy
out
in
whatpart
of
the
city
the
lamanites
did
camp
with
their
armyalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
on
the
east
by
theentrance
and
they
were
all
asleep

and
now
moroni
returned
tohis
army
and
caused
that
they
should
prepare
in
haste
strongcords
and
ladders
to
be
let
down
from
the
top
of
the
wall
intothe
inner
part
of
the
wallalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
caused
that
his
men
shouldmarch
forth
and
come
upon
the
top
of
the
wall
and
let
themselvesdown
into
that
part
of
the
city
yea
even
on
the
west
where
thelamanites
did
not
camp
with
their
armiesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
all
let
down
into
the
cityby
night
by
the
means
of
their
strong
cords
and
their
laddersthus
when
the
morning
came
they
were
all
within
the
walls
of
thecityalma


and
now
when
the
lamanites
awoke
and
saw
that
the
armies
ofmoroni
were
within
the
walls
they
were
affrighted
exceedinglyinsomuch
that
they
did
flee
out
by
the
passalma


and
now
when
moroni
saw
that
they
were
fleeing
before
him
hedid
cause
that
his
men
should
march
forth
against
them
and
slewmany
and
surrounded
many
others
and
took
them
prisoners
andthe
remainder
of
them
fled
into
the
land
of
moroni
which
was
inthe
borders
by
the
seashorealma


thus
had
moroni
and
pahoran
obtained
the
possession
of
thecity
of
nephihah
without
the
loss
of
one
soul
and
there
weremany
of
the
lamanites
who
were
slainalma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
many
of
the
lamanites
that
wereprisoners
were
desirous
to
join
the
people
of
ammon
and
become
afree
peoplealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
many
as
were
desirous
unto
themit
was
granted
according
to
their
desiresalma


therefore
all
the
prisoners
of
the
lamanites
did
join
thepeople
of
ammon
and
did
begin
to
labor
exceedingly
tilling
theground
raising
all
manner
of
grain
and
flocks
and
herds
ofevery
kind
and
thus
were
the
nephites
relieved
from
a
greatburden
yea
insomuch
that
they
were
relieved
from
all
theprisoners
of
the
lamanitesalma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
after
he
had
obtainedpossession
of
the
city
of
nephihah
having
taken
many
prisonerswhich
did
reduce
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
exceedingly
andhaving
regained
many
of
the
nephites
who
had
been
takenprisoners
which
did
strengthen
the
army
of
moroni
exceedinglytherefore
moroni
went
forth
from
the
land
of
nephihah
to
the
landof
lehialma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lamanites
saw
that
moroniwas
coming
against
them
they
were
again
frightened
and
fledbefore
the
army
of
moronialma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
and
his
army
did
pursue
themfrom
city
to
city
until
they
were
met
by
lehi
and
teancum
andthe
lamanites
fled
from
lehi
and
teancum
even
down
upon
theborders
by
the
seashore
until
they
came
to
the
land
of
moronialma


and
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
were
all
gathered
togetherinsomuch
that
they
were
all
in
one
body
in
the
land
of
moroni

now
ammoron
the
king
of
the
lamanites
was
also
with
themalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
and
lehi
and
teancum
didencamp
with
their
armies
round
about
in
the
borders
of
the
landof
moroni
insomuch
that
the
lamanites
were
encircled
about
inthe
borders
by
the
wilderness
on
the
south
and
in
the
borders
bythe
wilderness
on
the
eastalma


and
thus
they
did
encamp
for
the
night

for
behold
thenephites
and
the
lamanites
also
were
weary
because
of
thegreatness
of
the
march
therefore
they
did
not
resolve
upon
anystratagem
in
the
nighttime
save
it
were
teancum
for
he
wasexceedingly
angry
with
ammoron
insomuch
that
he
considered
thatammoron
and
amalickiah
his
brother
had
been
the
cause
of
thisgreat
and
lasting
war
between
them
and
the
lamanites
which
hadbeen
the
cause
of
so
much
war
and
bloodshed
yea
and
so
muchfaminealma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
teancum
in
his
anger
did
go
forthinto
the
camp
of
the
lamanites
and
did
let
himself
down
over
thewalls
of
the
city

and
he
went
forth
with
a
cord
from
place
toplace
insomuch
that
he
did
find
the
king
and
he
did
cast
ajavelin
at
him
which
did
pierce
him
near
the
heart

but
beholdthe
king
did
awaken
his
servants
before
he
died
insomuch
thatthey
did
pursue
teancum
and
slew
himalma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
lehi
and
moroni
knew
thatteancum
was
dead
they
were
exceedingly
sorrowful
for
behold
hehad
been
a
man
who
had
fought
valiantly
for
his
country
yea
atrue
friend
to
liberty
and
he
had
suffered
very
many
exceedinglysore
afflictions

but
behold
he
was
dead
and
had
gone
the
wayof
all
the
earthalma


now
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
marched
forth
on
the
morrowand
came
upon
the
lamanites
insomuch
that
they
did
slay
themwith
a
great
slaughter
and
they
did
drive
them
out
of
the
landand
they
did
flee
even
that
they
did
not
return
at
that
timeagainst
the
nephitesalma


and
thus
ended
the
thirty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudges
over
the
people
of
nephi
and
thus
they
had
had
wars
andbloodsheds
and
famine
and
affliction
for
the
space
of
manyyearsalma


and
there
had
been
murders
and
contentions
and
dissensionsand
all
manner
of
iniquity
among
the
people
of
nephinevertheless
for
the
righteous
sake
yea
because
of
the
prayersof
the
righteous
they
were
sparedalma


but
behold
because
of
the
exceedingly
great
length
of
thewar
between
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
many
had
becomehardened
because
of
the
exceedingly
great
length
of
the
war
andmany
were
softened
because
of
their
afflictions
insomuch
thatthey
did
humble
themselves
before
god
even
in
the
depth
ofhumilityalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
moroni
had
fortified
thoseparts
of
the
land
which
were
most
exposed
to
the
lamanites
untilthey
were
sufficiently
strong
he
returned
to
the
city
ofzarahemla
and
also
helaman
returned
to
the
place
of
hisinheritance
and
there
was
once
more
peace
established
among
thepeople
of
nephialma


and
moroni
yielded
up
the
command
of
his
armies
into
thehands
of
his
son
whose
name
was
moronihah
and
he
retired
to
hisown
house
that
he
might
spend
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
peacealma


and
pahoran
did
return
to
his
judgmentseat
and
helaman
didtake
upon
him
again
to
preach
unto
the
people
the
word
of
godfor
because
of
so
many
wars
and
contentions
it
had
becomeexpedient
that
a
regulation
should
be
made
again
in
the
churchalma


therefore
helaman
and
his
brethren
went
forth
and
diddeclare
the
word
of
god
with
much
power
unto
the
convincing
ofmany
people
of
their
wickedness
which
did
cause
them
to
repentof
their
sins
and
to
be
baptized
unto
the
lord
their
godalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
establish
again
the
churchof
god
throughout
all
the
landalma


yea
and
regulations
were
made
concerning
the
law

and
theirjudges
and
their
chief
judges
were
chosenalma


and
the
people
of
nephi
began
to
prosper
again
in
the
landand
began
to
multiply
and
to
wax
exceedingly
strong
again
in
theland

and
they
began
to
grow
exceedingly
richalma


but
notwithstanding
their
riches
or
their
strength
or
theirprosperity
they
were
not
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
eyesneither
were
they
slow
to
remember
the
lord
their
god
but
theydid
humble
themselves
exceedingly
before
himalma


yea
they
did
remember
how
great
things
the
lord
had
done
forthem
that
he
had
delivered
them
from
death
and
from
bonds
andfrom
prisons
and
from
all
manner
of
afflictions
and
he
haddelivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemiesalma


and
they
did
pray
unto
the
lord
their
god
continuallyinsomuch
that
the
lord
did
bless
them
according
to
his
word
sothat
they
did
wax
strong
and
prosper
in
the
landalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
all
these
things
were
done

died
in
the
thirty
and
fifth

and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of

thirty
andsixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of

shiblon
took
possession
of
those
sacred
things
which
hadbeen
delivered
unto

by

and
he
was
a
just
man
and
he
did
walk
uprightly
before
godand
he
did
observe
to
do
good
continually
to
keep
thecommandments
of
the
lord
his
god
and
also
did
his
brotheralma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moroni
died
also

and
thus
ended
thethirty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judgesalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
thirty
and
seventh
year
of
thereign
of
the
judges
there
was
a
large
company
of
men
even
tothe
amount
of
five
thousand
and
four
hundred
men
with
theirwives
and
their
children
departed
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemlainto
the
land
which
was
northwardalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
hagoth
he
being
an
exceedinglycurious
man
therefore
he
went
forth
and
built
him
an
exceedinglylarge
ship
on
the
borders
of
the
land
bountiful
by
the
landdesolation
and
launched
it
forth
into
the
west
sea
by
thenarrow
neck
which
led
into
the
land
northwardalma


and
behold
there
were
many
of
the
nephites
who
did
entertherein
and
did
sail
forth
with
much
provisions
and
also
manywomen
and
children
and
they
took
their
course
northward

andthus
ended
the
thirty
and
seventh
yearalma


and
in
the
thirty
and
eighth
year
this
man
built
other
shipsand
the
first
ship
did
also
return
and
many
more
people
didenter
into
it
and
they
also
took
much
provisions
and
set
outagain
to
the
land
northwardalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
never
heard
of
more

andwe
suppose
that
they
were
drowned
in
the
depths
of
the
sea

andit
came
to
pass
that
one
other
ship
also
did
sail
forth
andwhither
she
did
go
we
know
notalma


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
there
were
many
peoplewho
went
forth
into
the
land
northward

and
thus
ended
thethirty
and
eighth
yearalma


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reignof
the

shiblon
died
also
and
corianton
had
gone
forth
tothe
land
northward
in
a
ship
to
carry
forth
provisions
unto
thepeople
who
had
gone
forth
into
that
landalma


therefore
it
became
expedient
for
shiblon
to
confer
thosesacred
things
before
his
death
upon
the
son
of
helaman
who
wascalled
helaman
being
called
after
the
name
of
his
fatheralma


now
behold
all
those
engravings
which
were
in
the
possessionof
helaman
were
written
and
sent
forth
among
the
children
of
menthroughout
all
the
land
save
it
were
those
parts
which
had
beencommanded
by
alma
should
not
go
forthalma


nevertheless
these
things
were
to
be
kept
sacred
and
handeddown
from
one
generation
to
another
therefore
in
this
yearthey
had
been
conferred
upon
helaman
before
the
death
ofshiblonalma


and
it
came
to
pass
also
in
this
year
that
there
were
somedissenters
who
had
gone
forth
unto
the
lamanites
and
they
werestirred
up
again
to
anger
against
the
nephitesalma


and
also
in
this
same
year
they
came
down
with
a
numerousarmy
to
war
against
the
people
of
moronihah
or
against
the
armyof
moronihah
in
the
which
they
were
beaten
and
driven
back
againto
their

great
lossalma

thus
ended

thirty
and

and
now
behold
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
thefortieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
ofnephi
there
began
to
be
a
serious
difficulty
among
the
people
ofthe
nephiteshelaman


for
behold
pahoran
had
died
and
gone
the
way
of
all
theearth
therefore
there
began
to
be
a
serious
contentionconcerning
who
should
have
the
judgmentseat
among
the
brethrenwho
were
the
sons
of
pahoranhelaman


now
these
are
their
names
who
did
contend
for
thejudgmentseat
who
did
also
cause
the
people
to
contend
pahoranpaanchi
and
pacumenihelaman


now
these
are
not
all
the
sons
of
pahoran
for
he
had
manybut
these
are
they
who
did
contend
for
the
judgmentseattherefore
they
did
cause
three
divisions
among
the
peoplehelaman


nevertheless
it
came
to
pass
that
pahoran
was
appointed
bythe
voice
of
the
people
to
be
chief
judge
and
a
governor
over
thepeople
of
nephihelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
pacumeni
when
he
saw
that
he
couldnot
obtain
the
judgmentseat
he
did
unite
with
the
voice
of
thepeoplehelaman


but
behold
paanchi
and
that
part
of
the
people
that
weredesirous
that
he
should
be
their
governor
was
exceedingly
wroththerefore
he
was
about
to
flatter
away
those
people
to
rise
upin
rebellion
against
their
brethrenhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
about
to
do
this
behold
he
wastaken
and
was
tried
according
to
the
voice
of
the
people
andcondemned
unto
death
for
he
had
raised
up
in

andsought
to
destroy
the
liberty
of

now
when
those
people
who
were
desirous
that
he
should
betheir
governor
saw
that
he
was
condemned
unto
death
thereforethey
were
angry
and
behold
they
sent
forth
one
kishkumen
evento
the
judgmentseat
of
pahoran
and
murdered
pahoran
as
he
satupon
the
judgmentseathelaman


and
he
was
pursued
by
the
servants
of
pahoran
but
behold
sospeedy
was
the
flight
of
kishkumen
that
no
man
could
overtakehimhelaman


and
he
went
unto
those
that
sent
him
and
they
all
enteredinto
a
covenant
yea
swearing
by
their
everlasting
maker
thatthey
would
tell
no
man
that
kishkumen
had
murdered
pahoranhelaman


therefore
kishkumen
was
not
known
among
the
people
of
nephifor
he
was
in
disguise
at
the
time
that
he
murdered
pahoran

andkishkumen
and
his
band
who
had
covenanted
with
him
did
minglethemselves
among
the
people
in
a
manner
that
they
all
could
notbe
found
but
as
many
as
were
found
were
condemned
unto
deathhelaman


and
now
behold
pacumeni
was
appointed
according
to
thevoice
of
the
people
to
be
a
chief
judge
and
a
governor
over
thepeople
to
reign
in
the
stead
of
his
brother
pahoran
and
it
wasaccording
to
his
right

and
all
this
was
done
in
the
fortiethyear
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
and
it
had
an
endhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
first
year
of
the
reignof
the
judges
that
the
lamanites
had
gathered
together
aninnumerable
army
of
men
and
armed
them
with
swords
and
withcimeters
and
with
bows
and
with
arrows
and
with
headplatesand
with
breastplates
and
with
all
manner
of
shields
of
everykindhelaman


and
they
came
down
again
that
they
might
pitch
battle
againstthe
nephites

and
they
were
led
by
a
man
whose
name
wascoriantumr
and
he
was
a
descendant
of
zarahemla
and
he
was
adissenter
from
among
the
nephites
and
he
was
a
large
and
amighty
manhelaman


therefore
the
king
of
the
lamanites
whose
name
wastubaloth
who
was
the
son
of
ammoron
supposing
that
coriantumrbeing
a
mighty
man
could
stand
against
the
nephites
with
hisstrength
and
also
with
his
great
wisdom
insomuch
that
by
sendinghim
forth
he
should
gain
power
over
the
nephiteshelaman


therefore
he
did
stir
them
up
to
anger
and
he
did
gathertogether
his
armies
and
he
did
appoint
coriantumr
to
be
theirleader
and
did
cause
that
they
should
march
down
to
the
land
ofzarahemla
to
battle
against
the
nephiteshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
because
of
so
much
contention
and
somuch
difficulty
in
the
government
that
they
had
not
keptsufficient
guards
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
for
they
had
supposedthat
the
lamanites
durst
not
come
into
the
heart
of
their
landsto
attack
that
great
city
zarahemlahelaman


but
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
did
march
forth
at
thehead
of
his
numerous
host
and
came
upon
the
inhabitants
of
thecity
and
their
march
was
with
such
exceedingly
great
speed
thatthere
was
no
time
for
the
nephites
to
gather
together
theirarmieshelaman


therefore
coriantumr
did
cut
down
the
watch
by
the
entranceof
the
city
and
did
march
forth
with
his
whole
army
into
thecity
and
they
did
slay
every
one
who
did
oppose
them
insomuchthat
they
did
take
possession
of
the
whole
cityhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
pacumeni
who
was
the
chief
judgedid
flee
before
coriantumr
even
to
the
walls
of
the
city

andit
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
did
smite
him
against
the
wallinsomuch
that
he
died

and
thus
ended
the
days
of
pacumenihelaman


and
now
when
coriantumr
saw
that
he
was
in
possession
of
thecity
of
zarahemla
and
saw
that
the
nephites
had
fled
beforethem
and
were
slain
and
were
taken
and
were
cast
into
prisonand
that
he
had
obtained
the
possession
of
the
strongest
hold
inall
the
land
his
heart
took
courage
insomuch
that
he
was
aboutto
go
forth
against
all
the
landhelaman


and
now
he
did
not
tarry
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
but
he
didmarch
forth
with
a
large
army
even
towards
the
city
ofbountiful
for
it
was
his
determination
to
go
forth
and
cut
hisway
through
with
the
sword
that
he
might
obtain
the
north
partsof
the
landhelaman


and
supposing
that
their
greatest
strength
was
in
the
centerof
the
land
therefore
he
did
march
forth
giving
them
no
time
toassemble
themselves
together
save
it
were
in
small
bodies
and
inthis
manner
they
did
fall
upon
them
and
cut
them
down
to
theearthhelaman


but
behold
this
march
of
coriantumr
through
the
center
ofthe
land
gave
moronihah
great
advantage
over
themnotwithstanding
the
greatness
of
the
number
of
the
nephites
whowere
slainhelaman


for
behold
moronihah
had
supposed
that
the
lamanites
durstnot
come
into
the
center
of
the
land
but
that
they
would
attackthe
cities
round
about
in
the
borders
as
they
had
hitherto
donetherefore
moronihah
had
caused
that
their
strong
armies
shouldmaintain
those
parts
round
about
by
the
bordershelaman


but
behold
the
lamanites
were
not
frightened
according
tohis
desire
but
they
had
come
into
the
center
of
the
land
andhad
taken
the
capital
city
which
was
the
city
of
zarahemla
andwere
marching
through
the
most
capital
parts
of
the
land
slayingthe
people
with
a
great
slaughter
both
men
women
and
childrentaking
possession
of
many
cities
and
of
many
strongholdshelaman


but
when
moronihah
had
discovered
this
he
immediately
sentforth
lehi
with
an
army
round
about
to
head
them
before
theyshould
come
to
the
land
bountifulhelaman


and
thus
he
did
and
he
did
head
them
before
they
came
to
theland
bountiful
and
gave
unto
them
battle
insomuch
that
theybegan
to
retreat
back
towards
the
land
of
zarahemlahelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moronihah
did
head
them
in
theirretreat
and
did
give
unto
them
battle
insomuch
that
it
becamean
exceedingly
bloody
battle
yea
many
were
slain
and
among
thenumber
who
were
slain
coriantumr
was
also
foundhelaman


and
now
behold
the
lamanites
could
not
retreat
either
wayneither
on
the
north
nor
on
the
south
nor
on
the
east
nor
onthe
west
for
they
were
surrounded
on
every
hand
by
the
nephiteshelaman


and
thus
had
coriantumr
plunged
the
lamanites
into
the
midstof
the
nephites
insomuch
that
they
were
in
the
power
of
thenephites
and
he
himself
was
slain
and
the
lamanites
did
yieldthemselves
into
the
hands
of
the
nephiteshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
moronihah
took
possession
of
thecity
of
zarahemla
again
and
caused
that
the
lamanites
who
hadbeen
taken
prisoners
should
depart
out
of
the
land
in
peacehelaman


and
thus
ended
the
forty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudgeshelaman
chapter
helaman


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
second
year
of
the
reignof
the
judges
after
moronihah
had
established
again
peacebetween
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
behold
there
was
no
oneto
fill
the
judgmentseat
therefore
there
began
to
be
acontention
again
among
the
people
concerning
who
should
fill
thejudgmentseathelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
helaman
who
was
the
son
of
helamanwas
appointed
to
fill
the
judgmentseat
by
the
voice
of
thepeoplehelaman


but
behold
kishkumen
who
had
murdered
pahoran
did
lay
waitto
destroy
helaman
also
and
he
was
upheld
by
his
band
who
hadentered
into
a
covenant
that
no
one
should
know
his
wickednesshelaman


for
there
was
one
gadianton
who
was
exceedingly
expert
inmany
words
and
also
in
his
craft
to
carry
on
the
secret
work
ofmurder
and
of
robbery
therefore
he
became
the
leader
of
the
bandof
kishkumenhelaman


therefore
he
did
flatter
them
and
also
kishkumen
that
ifthey
would
place
him
in
the
judgmentseat
he
would
grant
untothose
who
belonged
to
his
band
that
they
should
be
placed
inpower
and
authority
among
the
people
therefore
kishkumen
soughtto
destroy
helamanhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
went
forth
towards
the
judgmentseatto
destroy
helaman
behold
one
of
the
servants
of
helaman
havingbeen
out
by
night
and
having
obtained
through
disguise
aknowledge
of
those
plans
which
had
been
laid
by
this
band
todestroy
helamanhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
met
kishkumen
and
he
gave
untohim
a
sign
therefore
kishkumen
made
known
unto
him
the
object
ofhis
desire
desiring
that
he
would
conduct
him
to
thejudgmentseat
that
he
might
murder
helamanhelaman


and
when
the
servant
of
helaman
had
known
all
the
heart
ofkishkumen
and
how
that
it
was
his
object
to
murder
and
alsothat
it
was
the
object
of
all
those
who
belonged
to
his
band
tomurder
and
to
rob
and
to
gain
power
and
this
was
their
secretplan
and
their
combination
the
servant
of
helaman
said
untokishkumen
let
us
go
forth
unto
the
judgmentseathelaman


now
this
did
please
kishkumen
exceedingly
for
he
did
supposethat
he
should
accomplish
his
design
but
behold
the
servant
ofhelaman
as
they
were
going
forth
unto
the
judgmentseat
didstab
kishkumen
even
to
the
heart
that
he
fell
dead
without
agroan

and
he
ran
and
told
helaman
all
the
things
which
he
hadseen
and
heard
and
donehelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
helaman
did
send
forth
to
take
thisband
of
robbers
and
secret
murderers
that
they
might
be
executedaccording
to
the
lawhelaman


but
behold
when
gadianton
had
found
that
kishkumen
did
notreturn
he
feared
lest
that
he
should
be
destroyed
therefore
hecaused
that
his
band
should
follow
him

and
they
took
theirflight
out
of
the
land
by
a
secret
way
into
the
wilderness
andthus
when
helaman
sent
forth
to
take
them
they
could
nowhere
befoundhelaman


and
more
of
this
gadianton
shall
be
spoken
hereafter

andthus
ended
the
forty
and
second
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judgesover
the
people
of
nephihelaman


and
behold
in
the
end
of
this
book
ye
shall
see
that
thisgadianton
did
prove
the
overthrow
yea
almost
the
entiredestruction
of
the
people
of
nephihelaman


behold
I
do
not
mean
the
end
of
the
book
of
helaman
but
Imean
the
end
of
the
book
of
nephi
from
which
I
have
taken
allthe
account
which
I
have
writtenhelaman
chapter
helaman


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
third
year
of
thereign
of
the
judges
there
was
no
contention
among
the
people
ofnephi
save
it
were
a
little
pride
which
was
in
the
church
whichdid
cause
some
little
dissensions
among
the
people
which
affairswere
settled
in
the
ending
of
the
forty
and
third
yearhelaman


and
there
was
no
contention
among
the
people
in
the
forty
andfourth
year
neither
was
there
much
contention
in
the
forty
andfifth
yearhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
sixth
yea
there
wasmuch
contention
and
many
dissensions
in
the
which
there
were
anexceedingly
great
many
who
departed
out
of
the
land
of
zarahemlaand
went
forth
unto
the
land
northward
to
inherit
the
landhelaman


and
they
did
travel
to
an
exceedingly
great
distance
insomuchthat
they
came
to
large
bodies
of
water
and
many
rivershelaman


yea
and
even
they
did
spread
forth
into
all
parts
of
theland
into
whatever
parts
it
had
not
been
rendered
desolate
andwithout
timber
because
of
the
many
inhabitants
who
had
beforeinherited
the
landhelaman


and
now
no
part
of
the
land
was
desolate
save
it
were
fortimber
but
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
destruction
of
thepeople
who
had
before
inhabited
the
land
it
was
called
desolatehelaman


and
there
being
but
little
timber
upon
the
face
of
the
landnevertheless
the
people
who
went
forth
became
exceedingly
expertin
the
working
of
cement
therefore
they
did
build
houses
ofcement
in
the
which
they
did
dwellhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
multiply
and
spread
and
didgo
forth
from
the
land
southward
to
the
land
northward
and
didspread
insomuch
that
they
began
to
cover
the
face
of
the
wholeearth
from
the
sea
south
to
the
sea
north
from
the
sea
west
tothe
sea
easthelaman


and
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
northward
did
dwell
intents
and
in
houses
of
cement
and
they
did
suffer
whatsoevertree
should
spring
up
upon
the
face
of
the
land
that
it
shouldgrow
up
that
in
time
they
might
have
timber
to
build
theirhouses
yea
their
cities
and
their
temples
and
theirsynagogues
and
their
sanctuaries
and
all
manner
of
theirbuildingshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
as
timber
was
exceedingly
scarce
in
theland
northward
they
did
send
forth
much
by
the
way
of
shippinghelaman


and
thus
they
did
enable
the
people
in
the
land
northwardthat
they
might
build
many
cities
both
of
wood
and
of
cementhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
of
the
people
ofammon
who
were
lamanites
by
birth
did
also
go
forth
into
thislandhelaman


and
now
there
are
many
records
kept
of
the
proceedings
ofthis
people
by
many
of
this
people
which
are
particular
andvery
large
concerning
themhelaman


but
behold
a
hundredth
part
of
the
proceedings
of
thispeople
yea
the
account
of
the
lamanites
and
of
the
nephitesand
their
wars
and
contentions
and
dissensions
and
theirpreaching
and
their
prophecies
and
their
shipping
and
theirbuilding
of
ships
and
their
building
of
temples
and
ofsynagogues
and
their
sanctuaries
and
their
righteousness
andtheir
wickedness
and
their
murders
and
their
robbings
andtheir
plundering
and
all
manner
of
abominations
and
whoredomscannot
be
contained
in
this
workhelaman


but
behold
there
are
many
books
and
many
records
of
everykind
and
they
have
been
kept
chiefly
by
the
nephiteshelaman


and
they
have
been
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
anotherby
the
nephites
even
until
they
have
fallen
into
transgressionand
have
been
murdered
plundered
and
hunted
and
driven
forthand
slain
and
scattered
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
mixedwith
the
lamanites
until
they
are
no
more
called
the
nephitesbecoming
wicked
and
wild
and
ferocious
yea
even
becominglamaniteshelaman


and
now
I
return
again
to
mine
account
therefore
what
Ihave
spoken
had
passed
after
there
had
been
great
contentionsand
disturbances
and
wars
and
dissensions
among
the
people
ofnephihelaman


the
forty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
endedhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
still
great
contention
inthe
land
yea
even
in
the
forty
and
seventh
year
and
also
inthe
forty
and
eighth
yearhelaman


nevertheless
helaman
did
fill
the
judgmentseat
with
justiceand
equity
yea
he
did
observe
to
keep
the
statutes
and
thejudgments
and
the
commandments
of
god
and
he
did
do
that
whichwas
right
in
the
sight
of
god
continually
and
he
did
walk
afterthe
ways
of
his
father
insomuch
that
he
did
prosper
in
the
landhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
had
two
sons

he
gave
unto
theeldest
the
name
of
nephi
and
unto
the
youngest
the
name
oflehi

and
they
began
to
grow
up
unto
the
lordhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
wars
and
contentions
began
tocease
in
a
small
degree
among
the
people
of
the
nephites
inthe
latter
end
of
the
forty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudges
over
the
people
of
nephihelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reignof
the
judges
there
was
continual
peace
established
in
the
landall
save
it
were
the
secret
combinations
which
gadianton
therobber
had
established
in
the
more
settled
parts
of
the
landwhich
at
that
time
were
not
known
unto
those
who
were
at
the
headof
government
therefore
they
were
not
destroyed
out
of
the
landhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
same
year
there
wasexceedingly
great
prosperity
in
the
church
insomuch
that
therewere
thousands
who
did
join
themselves
unto
the
church
and
werebaptized
unto
repentancehelaman


and
so
great
was
the
prosperity
of
the
church
and

and
it

and
in
this

there
was
continual
rejoicing
in

land
ofzarahemla
and
in
all
the
regions
round
about
even
in
all
theland
which
was
possessed
by

and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
peace
and
exceedinglygreat
joy
in
the
remainder
of
the
forty
and
ninth
year
yea
andalso
there
was
continual
peace
and
great
joy
in
the
fiftieth
yearof
the
reign
of
the
judgeshelaman


and
in
the
fifty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judgesthere
was
peace
also
save
it
were
the
pride
which
began
to
enterinto
the
churchnot
into
the
church
of
god
but
into
the
heartsof
the
people
who
professed
to
belong
to
the
church
of
godhelaman


and
they
were
lifted
up
in
pride
even
to
the
persecution
ofmany
of
their
brethren

now
this
was
a
great
evil
which
didcause
the
more
humble
part
of
the
people
to
suffer
greatpersecutions
and
to
wade
through
much
afflictionhelaman


nevertheless
they
did
fast
and
pray
oft
and
did
wax
strongerand
stronger
in
their
humility
and
firmer
and
firmer
in
thefaith
of
christ
unto
the
filling
their
souls
with
joy
andconsolation
yea
even
to
the
purifying
and
the
sanctification
oftheir
hearts
which
sanctification
cometh
because
of
theiryielding
their
hearts
unto
godhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
fifty
and
second
year
ended
inpeace
also
save
it
were
the
exceedingly
great
pride
which
hadgotten
into
the
hearts
of
the
people
and
it
was
because
of
theirexceedingly
great
riches
and
their
prosperity
in
the
land
and
itdid
grow
upon
them
from
day
to
dayhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifty
and
third
year
of
the
reignof
the
judges
helaman
died
and
his
eldest
son
nephi
began
toreign
in
his
stead

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
fill
thejudgmentseat
with
justice
and
equity
yea
he
did
keep
thecommandments
of
god
and
did
walk
in
the
ways
of

chapter
helaman


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifty
and
fourth
year
there
weremany
dissensions
in
the
church
and
there
was
also
a
contentionamong
the
people
insomuch
that
there
was
much
bloodshedhelaman


and
the
rebellious
part
were
slain
and
driven
out
of
the
landand
they
did
go
unto
the
king
of
the
lamaniteshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
endeavor
to
stir
up
thelamanites
to
war
against
the
nephites
but
behold
the
lamaniteswere
exceedingly
afraid
insomuch
that
they
would
not
hearken
tothe
words
of
those
dissentershelaman


but
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reignof
the
judges
there
were
dissenters
who
went
up
from
thenephites
unto
the
lamanites
and
they
succeeded
with
those
othersin
stirring
them
up
to
anger
against
the
nephites
and
they
wereall
that
year
preparing
for
warhelaman


and
in
the
fifty
and
seventh
year
they
did
come
down
againstthe
nephites
to
battle
and
they
did
commence
the
work
of
deathyea
insomuch
that
in
the
fifty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
ofthe
judges
they
succeeded
in
obtaining
possession
of
the
land
ofzarahemla
yea
and
also
all
the
lands
even
unto
the
land
whichwas
near
the
land
bountifulhelaman


and
the
nephites
and
the
armies
of
moronihah
were
driven
eveninto
the
land
of
bountifulhelaman


and
there
they
did
fortify
against
the
lamanites
from
thewest
sea
even
unto
the
east
it
being
a
days
journey
for
anephite
on
the
line
which
they
had
fortified
and
stationed
theirarmies
to
defend
their
north
countryhelaman


and
thus
those
dissenters
of
the
nephites
with
the
help
of
anumerous
army
of
the
lamanites
had
obtained
all
the
possessionof
the
nephites
which
was
in
the
land
southward

and
all
thiswas
done
in
the
fifty
and
eighth
and
ninth
years
of
the
reign
ofthe
judgeshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudges
moronihah
did
succeed
with
his
armies
in
obtaining
manyparts
of
the
land
yea
they
regained
many
cities
which
hadfallen
into
the
hands
of
the
lamaniteshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixty
and
first
year
of
the
reignof
the
judges
they
succeeded
in
regaining
even
the
half
of
alltheir
possessionshelaman


now
this
great
loss
of
the
nephites
and
the
great
slaughterwhich
was
among
them
would
not
have
happened
had
it
not
been
fortheir
wickedness
and
their
abomination
which
was
among
them
yeaand
it
was
among
those
also
who
professed
to
belong
to
the
churchof
godhelaman


and
it
was
because
of
the
pride
of
their
hearts
because
oftheir
exceeding
riches
yea
it
was
because
of
their
oppressionto
the
poor
withholding
their
food
from
the
hungry
withholdingtheir
clothing
from
the
naked
and
smiting
their
humble
brethrenupon
the
cheek
making
a
mock
of
that
which
was
sacred
denyingthe
spirit
of
prophecy
and
of
revelation
murdering
plunderinglying
stealing
committing
adultery
rising
up
in
greatcontentions
and
deserting
away
into
the
land
of
nephi
among
thelamaniteshelaman


and
because
of
this
their
great
wickedness
and
theirboastings
in
their
own
strength
they
were
left
in
their
ownstrength
therefore
they
did
not
prosper
but
were
afflicted
andsmitten
and
driven
before
the
lamanites
until
they
had
lostpossession
of
almost
all
their
landshelaman


but
behold
moronihah
did
preach
many
things
unto
the
peoplebecause
of
their
iniquity
and
also
nephi
and
lehi
who
were
thesons
of
helaman
did
preach
many
things
unto
the
people
yea
anddid
prophesy
many
things
unto
them
concerning
their
iniquitiesand
what
should
come
unto
them
if
they
did
not
repent
of
theirsinshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
repent
and
inasmuch
asthey
did
repent
they
did
begin
to
prosperhelaman


for
when
moronihah
saw
that
they
did
repent
he
did
venture
tolead
them
forth
from
place
to
place
and
from
city
to
city
evenuntil
they
had
regained
the
onehalf
of
their
property
and
theonehalf
of
all
their
landshelaman


and
thus
ended
the
sixty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudgeshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixty
and
second
year
of
the
reignof
the
judges
that
moronihah
could
obtain
no
more
possessionsover
the
lamaniteshelaman


therefore
they
did
abandon
their
design
to
obtain
theremainder
of
their
lands
for
so
numerous
were
the
lamanites
thatit
became
impossible
for
the
nephites
to
obtain
more
power
overthem
therefore
moronihah
did
employ
all
his
armies
inmaintaining
those
parts
which
he
had
takenhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
numberof
the
lamanites
the
nephites
were
in
great
fear
lest
theyshould
be
overpowered
and
trodden
down
and
slain
anddestroyedhelaman


yea
they
began
to
remember
the
prophecies
of
alma
and
alsothe
words
of
mosiah
and
they
saw
that
they
had
been
astiffnecked
people
and
that
they
had
set
at
naught
thecommandments
of
godhelaman


and
that
they
had
altered
and
trampled
under
their
feet
thelaws
of
mosiah
or
that
which
the
lord
commanded
him
to
give
untothe
people
and
they
saw
that
their
laws
had
become
corruptedand
that
they
had
become
a
wicked
people
insomuch
that
they
werewicked
even
like
unto
the
lamaniteshelaman


and
because
of
their
iniquity
the
church
had
begun
todwindle
and
they
began
to
disbelieve
in
the
spirit
of
prophecyand
in
the
spirit
of
revelation
and
the
judgments
of
god
didstare
them
in
the
facehelaman


and
they
saw
that
they
had
become
weak
like
unto
theirbrethren
the
lamanites
and
that
the
spirit
of
the
lord
did
nomore
preserve
them
yea
it
had
withdrawn
from
them
because
thespirit
of
the
lord
doth
not
dwell
in
unholy
templeshelaman


therefore
the
lord
did
cease
to
preserve
them
by
hismiraculous
and
matchless
power
for
they
had
fallen
into
a
stateof
unbelief
and
awful
wickedness
and
they
saw
that
the
lamaniteswere
exceedingly
more
numerous
than
they
and
except
they
shouldcleave
unto
the
lord
their
god
they
must
unavoidably
perishhelaman


for
behold
they
saw
that
the
strength
of
the
lamanites
wasas
great
as
their
strength
even
man
for
man

and
thus
had
theyfallen
into
this
great
transgression
yea
thus
had
they
becomeweak
because
of
their
transgression
in
the
space
of
not
manyyearshelaman
chapter
helaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
same
year
behold
nephidelivered
up
the
judgmentseat
to
a
man
whose
name
was
cezoramhelaman


for
as
their
laws
and
their
governments
were
established
bythe
voice
of
the
people
and
they
who
chose
evil
were
morenumerous
than
they
who
chose
good
therefore
they
were
ripeningfor
destruction
for
the
laws
had
become
corruptedhelaman


yea
and
this
was
not
all
they
were
a
stiffnecked
peopleinsomuch
that
they
could
not
be
governed
by
the
law
nor
justicesave
it
were
to
their
destructionhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
had
become
weary
because
oftheir
iniquity
and
he
yielded
up
the
judgmentseat
and
took
itupon
him
to
preach
the
word
of
god
all
the
remainder
of
his
daysand
his
brother
lehi
also
all
the
remainder
of
his
dayshelaman


for
they
remembered
the
words
which
their
father
helaman
spakeunto
them

and
these
are
the
words
which
he
spakehelaman


behold
my
sons
I
desire
that
ye
should
remember
to
keep
thecommandments
of
god
and
I
would
that
ye
should
declare
unto
thepeople
these
words

behold
I
have
given
unto
you
the
names
ofour
first
parents
who
came
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
thisI
have
done
that
when
you
remember
your
names
ye
may
rememberthem
and
when
ye
remember
them
ye
may
remember
their
works
andwhen
ye
remember
their
works
ye
may
know
how
that
it
is
said
andalso
written
that
they
were
goodhelaman


therefore
my
sons
I
would
that
ye
should
do
that
which
isgood
that
it
may
be
said
of
you
and
also
written
even
as
ithas
been
said
and
written
of
themhelaman


and
now
my
sons
behold
I
have
somewhat
more
to
desire
of
youwhich
desire
is
that
ye
may
not
do
these
things
that
ye
mayboast
but
that
ye
may
do
these
things
to
lay
up
for
yourselves
atreasure
in
heaven
yea
which
is
eternal
and
which
fadeth
notaway
yea
that
ye
may
have
that
precious
gift
of
eternal
lifewhich
we
have
reason
to
suppose
hath
been
given
to
our
fathershelaman


o
remember
remember
my
sons
the
words
which
king
benjaminspake
unto
his
people
yea
remember
that
there
is
no
other
waynor
means
whereby
man
can
be
saved
only
through
the
atoningblood
of
jesus
christ
who
shall
come
yea
remember
that
hecometh
to
redeem
the
worldhelaman


and
remember
also
the
words
which
amulek
spake
unto
zeezromin
the
city
of
ammonihah
for
he
said
unto
him
that
the
lordsurely
should
come
to
redeem
his
people
but
that
he
should
notcome
to
redeem
them
in
their
sins
but
to
redeem
them
from
theirsinshelaman


and
he
hath
power
given
unto
him
from
the
father
to
redeemthem
from
their
sins
because
of
repentance
therefore
he
hathsent
his
angels
to
declare
the
tidings
of
the
conditions
ofrepentance
which
bringeth
unto
the
power
of
the
redeemer
untothe
salvation
of
their
soulshelaman


and
now
my
sons
remember
remember
that
it
is
upon
the
rockof
our
redeemer
who
is
christ
the
son
of
god
that
ye
mustbuild
your
foundation
that
when
the
devil
shall
send
forth
hismighty
winds
yea
his
shafts
in
the
whirlwind
yea
when
all
hishail
and
his
mighty
storm
shall
beat
upon
you
it
shall
have
nopower
over
you
to
drag
you
down
to
the
gulf
of
misery
and
endlesswo
because
of
the
rock
upon
which
ye
are
built
which
is
a
surefoundation
a
foundation
whereon
if
men
build
they
cannot
fallhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
these
were
the
words
which
helamantaught
to
his
sons
yea
he
did
teach
them
many
things
which
arenot
written
and
also
many
things
which
are
writtenhelaman


and
they
did
remember
his
words
and
therefore
they
wentforth
keeping
the
commandments
of
god
to
teach
the
word
of
godamong
all
the
people
of
nephi
beginning
at
the
city
bountifulhelaman


and
from
thenceforth
to
the
city
of
gid
and
from
the
city
ofgid
to
the
city
of
mulekhelaman


and
even
from
one
city
to
another
until
they
had
gone
forthamong
all
the
people
of
nephi
who
were
in
the
land
southward
andfrom
thence
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
among
the
lamaniteshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
preach
with
great
powerinsomuch
that
they
did
confound
many
of
those
dissenters
who
hadgone
over
from
the
nephites
insomuch
that
they
came
forth
anddid
confess
their
sins
and
were
baptized
unto
repentance
andimmediately
returned
to
the
nephites
to
endeavor
to
repair
untothem
the
wrongs
which
they
had
donehelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
and
lehi
did
preach
unto
thelamanites
with
such
great
power
and
authority
for
they
had
powerand
authority
given
unto
them
that
they
might
speak
and
theyalso
had
what
they
should
speak
given
unto
themhelaman


therefore
they
did
speak
unto
the
great
astonishment
of
thelamanites
to
the
convincing
them
insomuch
that
there
were
eightthousand
of
the
lamanites
who
were
in
the
land
of
zarahemla
andround
about
baptized
unto
repentance
and
were
convinced
of
thewickedness
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathershelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
and
lehi
did
proceed
fromthence
to
go
to
the
land
of
nephihelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
taken
by
an
army
of
thelamanites
and
cast
into
prison
yea
even
in
that
same
prison
inwhich
ammon
and
his
brethren
were
cast
by
the
servants
of
limhihelaman


and
after
they
had
been
cast
into
prison
many
days
withoutfood
behold
they
went
forth
into
the
prison
to
take
them
thatthey
might
slay
themhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
and
lehi
were
encircled
aboutas

insomuch
that
they
durst
not

were
encircled

that

burned

for
they
saw
that

neither
durst
they
come

stood
asif

to

and
now
behold
he
had
got
great
hold
upon
the
hearts
of
thenephites

insomuch
that
they
had
become
exceedingly
wickedyea
the
more
part
of

had
turned
out
of
the
way
ofrighteousness
and
did
trample
under
their
feet
the
commandmentsof

and
did
turn
unto
their
own
ways
and
did
build
up
untothemselves
idols
of
their
gold

their
silverhelaman


and
it
came
to

that
all
these
iniquities
did
come
untothem

the
space
of
not
many
years

that
a
more

had
come
unto

they
did
grow
in
their
iniquities
in
the
sixty

eighthyear

and
thus
we
see
that
the
nephites
did
begin
to
dwindle
inunbelief
and
grow
in
wickedness
and
abominations
while
thelamanites
began
to
grow
exceedingly
in
the
knowledge
of

they
did
begin
to
keep
his
statutes

commandmentsand
to
walk
in
truth
and
uprightness
before

and
thus
we
see
that
the
spirit
of
the
lord
began
to
withdrawfrom
the
nephites
because
of
the
wickedness
and
the
hardness
oftheir
heartshelaman


and
thus
we
see
that
the
lord
began
to
pour
out
his
spiritupon
the
lamanites
because
of
their
easiness
and
willingness
tobelieve
in
his
wordshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
hunt
the
band
ofrobbers
of
gadianton
and
they
did
preach
the
word
of

amongthe
more
wicked
part
of

that
this
band
of

utterly
destroyed

it
came
to

on
the
other
hand
that
the
nephites
didbuild

up

support

beginning
at
the
more
wicked
partof
them
until
they
had
overspread
all
the
land

nephitesand
had
seduced
the
more
part
of

righteous

they
hadcome
down
to
believe
in
their
works
and
partake
of
their
spoilsand
to
join
with

in
their
secret
murders

and
thus
they
did
obtain
the
sole
management

that
they
did
trample

rend

now
this
great

had
come
upon

of
not
many
years
and
when

his

of

I
could
have
had
my
days
in

when
my
fathernephi
first
came
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
that
I
could
havejoyed
with
him
in
the
promised
land
then
were
his
people
easy
tobe
entreated
firm
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
slow
tobe
led
to
do
iniquity
and
they
were
quick
to
hearken
unto
thewords
of
the
lordhelaman


yea
if
my
days
could
have
been
in
those
days
then
would
mysoul
have
had

behold
I
am

these
are
my

that
mysoul
shall
be
filled
with
sorrow
because
of
this
the
wickednessof

and
behold
now
it
came
to

that
it
was
upon

towerwhich
was
in

which
was
by

and
it
came
to

that
there
were
certain
men
passing
byand
saw
nephi
as
he
was
pouring
out
his
soul
unto
god
upon
thetower
and
they
ran
and
told
the
people
what
they
had
seen

people
came
together
in
multitudes
that
they
might
know
thecause
of
so
great
mourning

and
now
when

arose
he
beheld

had
gathered

and
it
came
to

that
he
opened

helaman


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
nephi
had
said
these
wordsbehold
there
were
men
who
were
judges
who
also
belonged
to
thesecret
band
of
gadianton
and
they
were
angry
and
they
cried
outagainst
him
saying
unto
the
people
why
do
ye
not
seize
uponthis
man
and
bring
him
forth
that
he
may
be
condemned
accordingto
the
crime
which
he
has
donehelaman


why
seest
thou
this
man
and
hearest
him
revile
against
thispeople
and
against
our
lawhelaman


for
behold
nephi
had
spoken
unto
them
concerning
thecorruptness
of
their
law
yea
many
things
did
nephi
speak
whichcannot
be
written
and
nothing
did
he
speak
which
was
contrary
tothe
commandments
of
godhelaman


and
those
judges
were
angry
with
him
because
he
spake
plainlyunto
them
concerning
their
secret
works
of
darknessnevertheless
they
durst
not
lay
their
own
hands
upon
him
forthey
feared
the
people
lest
they
should
cry
out
against
themhelaman


therefore
they
did
cry
unto
the
people
saying
why
do
yousuffer
this
man
to
revile
against
us

for
behold
he
doth
condemnall
this
people
even
unto
destruction
yea
and
also
that
theseour
great
cities
shall
be
taken
from
us
that
we
shall
have
noplace
in
themhelaman


and
now
we
know
that
this
is
impossible
for
behold
we
arepowerful
and
our
cities
great
therefore
our
enemies
can
have
nopower
over
ushelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
they
did
stir
up
the
people
toanger
against
nephi
and
raised
contentions
among
them
for
therewere
some
who
did
cry
out
let
this
man
alone
for
he
is
a
goodman
and
those
things
which
he
saith
will
surely
come
to
passexcept
we
repenthelaman


yea
behold
all
the
judgments
will
come
upon
us
which
he
hastestified
unto
us
for
we
know
that
he
has
testified
aright
untous
concerning
our
iniquities

and
behold
they
are
many
and
heknoweth
as
well
all
things
which
shall
befall
us
as
he
knoweth
ofour
iniquitieshelaman


yea
and
behold
if
he
had
not
been
a
prophet
he
could
nothave
testified
concerning
those
thingshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
people
who
sought
to
destroynephi
were
compelled
because
of
their
fear
that
they
did
not
laytheir
hands
on
him
therefore
he
began
again
to
speak
unto
themseeing
that
he
had
gained
favor
in
the
eyes
of
some
insomuchthat
the
remainder
of
them
did
fearhelaman


therefore
he
was
constrained
to
speak
more
unto
them
sayingbehold
my
brethren
have
ye
not
read
that
god
gave
power
untoone
man
even
moses
to
smite
upon
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
andthey
parted
hither
and
thither
insomuch
that
the
Israelites
whowere
our
fathers
came
through
upon
dry
ground
and
the
watersclosed
upon
the
armies
of
the
egyptians
and
swallowed
them
uphelaman


and
now
behold
if
god
gave
unto
this
man
such
power
thenwhy
should
ye
dispute
among
yourselves
and
say
that
he
hathgiven
unto
me
no
power
whereby
I
may
know
concerning
thejudgments
that
shall
come
upon
you
except
ye
repenthelaman


but
behold
ye
not
only
deny
my
words
but
ye
also
deny
allthe
words
which
have
been
spoken
by
our
fathers
and
also
thewords
which
were
spoken
by
this
man
moses
who
had
such
greatpower
given
unto
him
yea
the
words
which
he
hath
spokenconcerning
the
coming
of
the
messiahhelaman


yea
did
he
not
bear
record
that
the
son
of
god
should
come
and
as
he
lifted
up
the
brazen
serpent
in
the
wilderness
even
soshall
he
be
lifted
up
who
should
comehelaman


and
as
many
as
should
look
upon
that
serpent
should
liveeven
so
as
many
as
should
look
upon
the
son
of
god
with
faithhaving
a
contrite
spirit
might
live
even
unto
that
life
whichis
eternalhelaman


and
now
behold
moses
did
not
only
testify
of
these
thingsbut
also
all
the
holy
prophets
from
his
days
even
to
the
days
ofabrahamhelaman


yea
and
behold
abraham
saw
of
his
coming
and
was
filledwith
gladness
and
did
rejoicehelaman


yea
and
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
abraham
not
only
knew
ofthese
things
but
there
were
many
before
the
days
of
abraham
whowere
called
by
the
order
of
god
yea
even
after
the
order
of
hisson
and
this
that
it
should
be
shown
unto
the
people
a
greatmany
thousand
years
before
his
coming
that
even
redemptionshould
come
unto
themhelaman


and
now
I
would
that
ye
should
know
that
even
since
the
daysof
abraham
there
have
been
many
prophets
that
have
testifiedthese
things
yea
behold
the
prophet
zenos
did
testify
boldlyfor
the
which
he
was
slainhelaman


and
behold
also
zenock
and
also
ezias
and
also
Isaiah
andjeremiah
jeremiah
being
that
same
prophet
who
testified
of
thedestruction
of
jerusalem
and
now
we
know
that
jerusalem
wasdestroyed
according
to
the
words
of
jeremiah

o
then
why
not
theson
of
god
come
according
to
his
prophecyhelaman


and
now
will
you
dispute
that
jerusalem
was
destroyed

willye
say
that
the
sons
of
zedekiah
were
not
slain
all
except
itwere
mulek

yea
and
do
ye
not
behold
that
the
seed
of
zedekiahare
with
us
and
they
were
driven
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
but
behold
this
is
not
allhelaman


our
father
lehi
was
driven
out
of
jerusalem
because
hetestified
of
these
things

nephi
also
testified
of
these
thingsand
also
almost
all
of
our
fathers
even
down
to
this
time
yeathey
have
testified
of
the
coming
of
christ
and
have
lookedforward
and
have
rejoiced
in
his
day
which
is
to
comehelaman


and
behold
he
is
god
and
he
is
with
them
and
he
didmanifest
himself
unto
them
that
they
were
redeemed
by
him
andthey
gave
unto
him
glory
because
of
that
which
is
to
comehelaman


and
now
seeing
ye
know
these
things
and
cannot
deny
themexcept
ye
shall
lie
therefore
in
this
ye
have
sinned
for
yehave
rejected

so
many

behold
ye
have
rejected
the
truth
and
rebelled
againstyour
holy

even
at
this
time
instead
of
laying
up
foryourselves
treasures
in

where
nothing
doth
corrupt

nothing
can
come

is
unclean
ye
are
heaping
up
foryourselves

against

yea
even
at
this

ye
are
ripening

your
fornication

there
were

marvelousthings
unto

that

and
there
were
some
of
the
nephites
who
believed
on
the
wordsof

and
there
were
some
also
who
believed
because
of
thetestimony
of
the
five
for
they
had
been
converted
while
theywere
in

and
now
there

some
among

they
divided

and
wenttheir
ways
leaving

alone
as
he
was

and
it
came
to

that
nephi
went
his
way
towards
his

pondering
upon
the
things
which
the

had
shown

and
it

and
behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
lord
had
spokenthese
words
unto
nephi
he
did
stop
and
did
not
go
unto
his
ownhouse
but
did
return
unto
the
multitudes
who
were
scatteredabout
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
began
to
declare
unto
themthe
word
of
the
lord
which
had
been
spoken
unto
him
concerningtheir
destruction
if
they
did
not
repenthelaman


now
behold
notwithstanding
that
great
miracle
which
nephihad
done
in
telling
them
concerning
the
death
of
the
chief
judgethey
did
harden
their
hearts
and
did
not
hearken
unto
the
wordsof

therefore
nephi
did
declare
unto
them
the
word
of
the
lordsaying
except
ye
repent
thus
saith
the
lord
ye
shall
besmitten

and
it
came
to

that
when
nephi
had
declared
unto

word
behold
they
did
still
harden
their
hearts
and
wouldnot
hearken
unto
his
words
therefore
they
did
revile

and
did
seek
to
lay
their
hands
upon

that
they
mightcast
him
into
prisonhelaman


but
behold
the
power
of
god
was
with
him
and
they
could
nottake
him
to
cast
him
into

for
he
was
taken
by
the
spiritand
conveyed
away
out
of

midst
of

and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
he
did
go
forth
in
the
spiritfrom
multitude
to

declaring
the
word
of

he
had
declared
it
unto

and
it
came
to

that
they
would
not
hearken

there
began
to
be
contentions
insomuch
that
they
weredivided
against

and
began
to
slay

another
with

thus
ended

year
of

and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventy

second
year
of

of
the
judges
that
the
contentions
did
increase
insomuchthat
there
were
wars
throughout
all
the
land
among
all
the
peopleof
nephihelaman


and
it
was
this
secret
band
of
robbers
who
did
carry
on
thiswork
of
destruction
and
wickedness

and
this
war
did
last
allthat
year
and
in
the
seventy
and
third

it
did
also
lasthelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
nephi
did
cry
unto

sayinghelaman


o
lord
do
not
suffer
that
this
people
shall
be
destroyed
bythe

but
o

be
a
famine
in

stir

up
in

of

and
so
it
was
done
according
to
the
words
of

andthere
was
a
great
famine
upon

land
among

the
famine
didcontinue
and
the
work
of

did
cease

butbecame
sore
by

and
this
work
of

did
also
continue
in

smitten

it
was
dry

not
yield
forth

the
wholeearth
was
smitten

well
as

so
that
they
were
smitten
that
they
did
perish
bythousands
in

more
wicked
parts
of

landhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
saw
that
they
were
aboutto
perish
by
famine
and
they
began
to
remember
the
lord
theirgod
and
they
began
to
remember
the
words
of
nephihelaman


and
the
people
began
to
plead
with
their
chief
judges
andtheir
leaders
that
they
would
say
unto
nephi
behold
we
knowthat
thou
art
a
man
of

and
therefore
cry
unto
the
lord
ourgod
that
he
turn
away
from
us
this
famine
lest
all
the
wordswhich
thou
hast
spoken
concerning

fulfilledhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
judges
did
say
unto
nephiaccording
to
the
words
which
had
been
desired

and
it
came
topass
that
when
nephi
saw
that
the
people
had
repented
and
didhumble
themselves
in
sackcloth
he
cried
again
unto
the
lordsayinghelaman

now
o

because
of
this
their
humility
wilt
thou

o

wilt
thou
turn

and
cause

famine
may
cease
in

o

wilt
thou
hearken
unto
me
and
cause
that
it
may
bedone
according
to
my
words
and
send

ofthe
earth
that
she
may
bring

fruit
and
her
grain
inthe
season
of

o

thou
didst
hearken
unto
my
words
when
I
said
letthere
be
a

that
the
pestilence
of

might
ceaseand
I
know
that
thou
wilt
even
at
this
time
hearken
unto
mywords
for
thou
saidst
that
If

yea
o

and
thou
seest
that
they
have
repented

the
pestilence
and

and
now
o

wilt
thou
turn

and
tryagain

and
if
so
o

thou
canstbless

saidhelaman


and
it
came
to

that
in

and
caused

insomuch
that

and
it
came
to

thatit
did
bring
forth
her
grain
in
the
season
of

grainhelaman


and
behold
the
people
did
rejoice
and
glorify
god
and
thewhole
face
of
the
land
was
filled
with
rejoicing
and
they
did
nomore
seek
to
destroy
nephi
but
they
did
esteem
him
as
a
greatprophet
and
a
man
of

authority
givenunto
him
from

and
behold
lehi
his

was
not
a

and
thus
it
did
come
to

that
the
people
of

beganto
prosper
again
in

and
began
to
build
up

they
did
put
an
end
to
their
strife
in
thatsame
yearhelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
eightieth
year
of
the
reignof
the
judges
over
the
people
of
nephi
there
were
a
certainnumber
of
the
dissenters
from
the
people
of
nephi
who
had
someyears
before
gone
over
unto
the
lamanites
and
taken
uponthemselves
the
name
of
lamanites
and
also
a
certain
number
whowere
real
descendants
of
the
lamanites
being
stirred
up
to
angerby
them
or
by
those
dissenters
therefore
they
commenced
a
warwith
their
brethrenhelaman


and
they
did
commit
murder
and
plunder
and
then
they
wouldretreat
back
into
the
mountains
and
into
the
wilderness
andsecret
places
hiding
themselves
that
they
could
not
bediscovered
receiving
daily
an
addition
to
their
numbersinasmuch
as
there
were
dissenters
that
went
forth
unto
themhelaman


and
thus
in
time
yea
even
in
the
space
of
not
many
yearsthey
became
an
exceedingly
great
band
of
robbers
and
they
didsearch
out
all
the
secret
plans
of
gadianton
and
thus
theybecame
robbers
of
gadiantonhelaman


now
behold
these
robbers
did
make
great
havoc
yea
evengreat
destruction
among
the
people
of
nephi
and
also
among
thepeople
of
the
lamaniteshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
expedient
that
there
shouldbe
a
stop
put
to
this
work
of
destruction
therefore
they
sent
anarmy
of
strong
men
into
the
wilderness
and
upon
the
mountains
tosearch
out
this
band
of
robbers
and
to
destroy
themhelaman


but
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
in
that
same
year
they
weredriven
back
even
into
their
own
lands

and
thus
ended
theeightieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
ofnephihelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
eighty
andfirst
year
they
did
go
forth
again
against
this
band
of
robbersand
did
destroy
many
and
they
were
also
visited
with
muchdestructionhelaman


and
they
were
again
obliged
to
return
out
of
the
wildernessand
out
of
the
mountains
unto
their
own
lands
because
of
theexceeding
greatness
of
the
numbers
of
those
robbers
who
infestedthe
mountains
and
the
wildernesshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
ended
this
year

and
therobbers
did
still
increase
and
wax
strong
insomuch
that
they
diddefy
the
whole
armies
of
the
nephites
and
also
of
the
lamanitesand
they
did
cause
great
fear
to
come
unto
the
people
upon
allthe
face
of
the
landhelaman


yea
for
they
did
visit
many
parts
of
the
land
and
did
dogreat
destruction
unto
them
yea
did
kill
many
and
did
carryaway
others
captive
into
the
wilderness
yea
and
more
especiallytheir
women
and
their
childrenhelaman


now
this
great
evil
which
came
unto
the
people
because
oftheir
iniquity
did
stir
them
up
again
in
remembrance
of
the
lordtheir
godhelaman


and
thus
ended
the
eighty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudgeshelaman


and
in
the
eighty
and
second
year
they
began
again
to
forgetthe
lord
their
god

and
in
the
eighty
and
third
year
they
beganto
wax
strong
in
iniquity

and
in
the
eighty
and
fourth
yearthey
did
not
mend
their
wayshelaman


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eighty
and
fifth
year
they
did
waxstronger
and
stronger
in
their
pride
and
in
their
wickednessand
thus
they
were
ripening
again
for
destructionhelaman


and
thus
ended
the
eighty
and
fifth
yearhelaman
chapter
helaman


and
thus
we
can
behold
how
false
and
also
the
unsteadiness
ofthe
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
yea
we
can
see
that
the
lordin
his
great
infinite
goodness
doth
bless
and
prosper
those
whoput
their
trust
in

yea
and
we
may
see
at
the
very
time
when
he
doth
prosper
hispeople
yea
in
the
increase
of
their
fields
their
flocks
andtheir
herds
and
in
gold
and
in
silver
and
in
all
manner
ofprecious
things
of
every
kind
and
art
sparing
their
lives
anddelivering
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
softening
thehearts
of
their
enemies
that
they
should
not
declare
wars
againstthem
yea
and
in
fine
doing
all
things
for
the
welfare
andhappiness
of
his
people
yea
then
is
the
time
that
they
doharden
their
hearts
and
do
forget
the
lord

god
and
dotrample
under
their
feet
the
holy
oneyea
and
this
because
oftheir
ease
and
their
exceedingly
great
prosperityhelaman


and
thus
we
see
that
except
the
lord
doth
chasten
his
peoplewith
many
afflictions
yea
except
he
doth
visit
them
with
deathand
with
terror

with

with

and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eighty

sixth

thenephites
did
still
remain
in
wickedness
yea
in
great
wickednesswhile
the
lamanites
did
observe
strictly
to
keep
the
commandmentsof

according
to
the
law
of

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
there
was
one
samuel
alamanite
came
into
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
began
to
preachunto
the

and
it
came
to

that
he
did
preach
manydays

and
they
did
cast

but
behold
the
voice
of

that

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
would
not
suffer
that
he
shouldenter
into

therefore
he
went
and
got
upon
the
wallthereof
and
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
cried
with
a
loudvoice
and
prophesied
unto
the
people
whatsoever

and
he
said
unto
them
behold
I
samuel

but
the
more
part

did
not

therefore
when
they
saw
that
they
could
not
hit

cried
unto

hedid

down

did
flee
out
of

even
unto
his
own
country
and
began
to
preach
and
toprophesy
among
his
own
peoplehelaman


and
behold
he
was
never
heard
of
more
among
the
nephites
andthus
were
the
affairs

and
thus
ended

eighty

and
thus
ended
also
the
eighty
and
seventh
year
of
the
reignof
the

the
more
part
of
the
people
remaining
in
theirpride
and
wickedness
and
the
lesser
part
walking
morecircumspectly
before
godhelaman


and
these
were
the
conditions
also
in
the
eighty
and
eighthyear
of
the
reign
of
the
judgeshelaman


and
there
was
but
little
alteration
in
the
affairs
of
thepeople
save
it
were
the
people
began
to
be
more
hardened
ininiquity
and
do
more
and
more
of
that
which
was
contrary
to
thecommandments
of
god
in
the
eighty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
ofthe
judgeshelaman


but
it
came
to
pass
in
the
ninetieth
year
of
the
reign
of
thejudges
there
were
great
signs
given
unto
the
people
andwonders
and
the
words
of
the
prophets
began
to
be
fulfilledhelaman


and
angels
did
appear
unto
men
wise
men
and
did
declareunto
them
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
thus
in
this
year
thescriptures
began
to
be
fulfilledhelaman


nevertheless
the
people
began
to
harden
their
hearts
allsave
it
were
the
most
believing
part
of
them
both
of
thenephites
and
also
of
the
lamanites
and
began
to
depend
upontheir
own
strength
and
upon
their
own
wisdom
sayinghelaman


some
things
they
may
have
guessed
right
among
so
many
butbehold
we
know
that
all
these
great
and
marvelous
works
cannotcome
to
pass
of
which
has
been
spokenhelaman


and
they
began
to
reason
and
to
contend
among
themselvessayinghelaman


that
it
is
not
reasonable
that
such
a
being
as
a
christ
shallcome
if
so
and
he
be
the
son
of
god
the
father
of
heaven
andof
earth
as
it
has
been
spoken
why
will
he
not
show
himselfunto
us
as
well
as
unto
them
who
shall
be
at
jerusalemhelaman


yea
why
will
he
not
show
himself
in
this
land
as
well
as
inthe
land
of
jerusalemhelaman


but
behold
we
know
that
this
is
a
wicked
tradition
whichhas
been
handed
down
unto
us
by
our
fathers
to
cause
us
that
weshould
believe
in
some
great
and
marvelous
thing
which
shouldcome
to
pass
but
not
among
us
but
in
a
land
which
is
fardistant
a
land
which
we
know
not
therefore
they
can
keep
us
inignorance
for
we
cannot
witness
with
our
own
eyes
that
they
aretruehelaman


and
they
will
by
the
cunning
and
the
mysterious
arts
of
theevil
one
work
some
great
mystery
which
we
cannot
understandwhich
will
keep
us
down
to
be
servants
to
their
words
and
alsoservants
unto
them
for
we
depend
upon
them
to
teach
us
the
wordand
thus
will
they
keep
us
in
ignorance
if
we
will
yieldourselves
unto
them
all
the
days
of
our
liveshelaman


and
many
more
things
did
the
people
imagine
up
in
theirhearts
which
were
foolish
and
vain
and
they
were
muchdisturbed
for
satan
did
stir
them
up
to
do
iniquity
continuallyyea
he
did
go
about
spreading
rumors
and
contentions
upon
allthe
face
of
the
land
that
he
might
harden
the
hearts
of
thepeople
against
that
which
was
good
and
against
that
which
shouldcomehelaman


and
notwithstanding
the
signs
and
the
wonders
which
werewrought
among
the
people
of
the
lord
and
the
many
miracles
whichthey
did
satan
did
get
great
hold
upon

hearts

thus

now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
ninety
and
first
year
had
passedaway
and
it
was
six
hundred
years
from
the
time
that

leftjerusalem

it
was
in

that
lachoneus
was

and
nephi

his

did
keep

in

the
record
of

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
commencement
of
the
ninety
andsecond
year
behold
the
prophecies
of
the
prophets
began
to
befulfilled
more
fully
for
there
began
to
be
greater
signs
andgreater
miracles
wrought
among
the
people
nephi


but
there
were
some
who
began
to
say
that
the
time
was
pastfor
the
words
to
be
fulfilled
which
were
spoken
by
samuel
thelamanite
nephi


and
they
began
to
rejoice
over
their
brethren
saying
beholdthe
time
is
past
and
the
words
of
samuel
are
not
fulfilledtherefore
your
joy
and
your
faith
concerning
this
thing
hathbeen
vain
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
make
a
great
uproarthroughout
the
land
and
the
people
who
believed
began
to
be
verysorrowful
lest
by
any
means
those
things
which
had
been
spokenmight
not
come
to
pass
nephi


but
behold
they
did
watch
steadfastly
for
that
day
and
thatnight
and
that
day
which
should
be
as
one
day
as
if
there
were
nonight
that
they
might
know
that
their
faith
had
not
been
vain
nephi


now
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
a
day
set
apart
by
theunbelievers
that
all
those
who
believed
in
those
traditionsshould
be
put
to
death
except
the
sign
should
come
to
pass
whichhad
been
given
by
samuel
the
prophet
nephi


now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
nephi
the
son
of
nephi
sawthis
wickedness
of
his
people
his
heart
was
exceedinglysorrowful
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
went
out
and
bowed
himself
downupon
the
earth
and
cried
mightily
to
his
god
in
behalf
of
hispeople
yea
those
who
were
about
to
be
destroyed
because
oftheir
faith
in
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
cried
mightily
unto
the
lord
allthat
day
and
behold
the
voice
of
the
lord
came
unto
himsaying
nephi


lift
up
your
head
and
be
of
good
cheer
for
behold
the
timeis
at
hand
and
on
this
night
shall
the
sign
be
given
and
on
themorrow
come
I
into
the
world
to
show
unto
the
world
that
I
willfulfill
all
that
which
I
have
caused
to
be
spoken
by
the
mouth
ofmy
holy
prophets
nephi


behold
I
come
unto
my
own
to
fulfill
all
things
which
Ihave
made
known
unto
the
children
of
men
from
the
foundation
ofthe
world
and
to
do
the
will
both
of
the
father
and
of
thesonof
the
father
because
of
me
and
of
the
son
because
of
myflesh

and
behold
the
time
is
at
hand
and
this
night
shall
thesign
be
given
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
words
which
came
unto
nephi
werefulfilled
according
as
they
had
been
spoken
for
behold
at
thegoing
down
of
the
sun
there
was
no
darkness
and
the
people
beganto
be
astonished
because
there
was
no
darkness
when
the
nightcame
nephi


and
there
were
many
who
had
not
believed
the
words
of
theprophets
who
fell
to
the
earth
and
became
as
if
they
were
deadfor
they
knew
that
the
great
plan
of
destruction
which
they
hadlaid
for
those
who
believed
in
the
words
of
the
prophets
had
beenfrustrated
for
the
sign
which
had
been
given
was
already
athand
nephi


and
they
began
to
know
that
the
son
of
god
must
shortlyappear
yea
in
fine
all
the
people
upon
the
face
of
the
wholeearth
from
the
west
to
the
east
both
in
the
land
north
and
inthe
land
south
were
so
exceedingly
astonished
that
they
fell
tothe
earth
nephi


for
they
knew
that
the
prophets
had
testified
of
these
thingsfor
many
years
and
that
the
sign
which
had
been
given
wasalready
at
hand
and
they
began
to
fear
because
of
their
iniquityand
their
unbelief
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
no
darkness
in
all
thatnight
but
it
was
as
light
as
though
it
was
midday

and
it
cameto
pass
that
the
sun
did
rise
in
the
morning
again
according
toits
proper
order
and
they
knew
that
it
was
the
day
that
the
lordshould
be
born
because
of
the
sign
which
had
been
given
nephi


and
it
had
come
to
pass
yea
all
things
every
whitaccording
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
also
that
a
new
star
did
appearaccording
to
the
word
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
from
this
time
forth
there
began
tobe
lyings
sent
forth
among
the
people
by
satan
to
harden
theirhearts
to
the
intent
that
they
might
not
believe
in
those
signsand
wonders
which
they
had
seen
but
notwithstanding
these
lyingsand
deceivings
the
more
part
of
the
people
did
believe
and
wereconverted
unto
the
lord
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
went
forth
among
the
peopleand
also
many
others
baptizing
unto
repentance
in
the
whichthere
was
a
great
remission
of
sins

and
thus
the
people
beganagain
to
have
peace
in
the
land
nephi


and
there
were
no
contentions
save
it
were
a
few
that
beganto
preach
endeavoring
to
prove
by
the
scriptures
that
it
was
nomore
expedient
to
observe
the
law
of
moses

now
in
this
thingthey
did
err
having
not
understood
the
scriptures
nephi


but
it
came
to
pass
that
they
soon
became
converted
and
wereconvinced
of
the
error
which
they
were
in
for
it
was
made
knownunto
them
that
the
law
was
not
yet
fulfilled
and
that
it
must
befulfilled
in
every
whit
yea
the
word
came
unto
them
that
itmust
be
fulfilled
yea
that
one
jot
or
tittle
should
not
passaway
till
it
should
all
be
fulfilled
therefore
in
this
same
yearwere
they
brought
to
a
knowledge
of
their
error
and
did
confesstheir
faults
nephi


and
thus
the
ninety
and
second
year
did
pass
away
bringingglad
tidings
unto
the
people
because
of
the
signs
which
did
cometo
pass
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophecy
of
all
the
holyprophets
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
ninety
and
third
year
did
alsopass
away
in
peace
save
it
were
for
the
gadianton
robbers
whodwelt
upon
the
mountains
who
did
infest
the
land
for
so
strongwere
their
holds
and
their
secret
places
that
the
people
couldnot
overpower
them
therefore
they
did
commit
many
murders
anddid
do
much
slaughter
among
the
people
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
ninety
and
fourth
year
theybegan
to
increase
in
great
degree
because
there
were
manydissenters
of
the
nephites
who
did
flee
unto
them
which
didcause
much
sorrow
unto
those
nephites
who
did
remain
in
the
land
nephi


and
there
was
also
a
cause
of
much
sorrow
among
thelamanites
for
behold
they
had
many
children
who
did
grow
up
andbegan
to
wax
strong
in
years
that
they
became
for
themselvesand
were
led
away
by
some
who
were
zoramites
by
their
lyings
andtheir
flattering
words
to
join
those
gadianton
robbers
nephi


and
thus
were
the
lamanites
afflicted
also
and
began
todecrease
as
to
their
faith
and
righteousness
because
of
thewickedness
of
the
rising
generation
nephi
chapter

nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
passed
away
the
ninety
and
fifthyear
also
and
the
people
began
to
forget
those
signs
and
wonderswhich
they
had
heard
and
began
to
be
less
and
less
astonished
ata
sign
or
a
wonder
from
heaven
insomuch
that
they
began
to
behard
in
their
hearts
and
blind
in
their
minds
and
began
todisbelieve
all
which
they
had
heard
and
seen
nephi


Imagining
up
some
vain
thing
in
their
hearts
that
it
waswrought
by
men
and
by
the
power
of
the
devil
to
lead
away
anddeceive
the
hearts
of
the
people
and
thus
did
satan
getpossession
of
the
hearts
of
the
people
again
insomuch
that
hedid
blind
their
eyes
and
lead
them
away
to
believe
that
thedoctrine
of
christ
was
a
foolish
and
a
vain
thing
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
began
to
wax
strong
inwickedness
and
abominations
and
they
did
not
believe
that
thereshould
be
any
more
signs
or
wonders
given
and
satan
did
goabout
leading
away
the
hearts
of
the
people
tempting
them
andcausing
them
that
they
should
do
great
wickedness
in
the
land
nephi


and
thus
did
pass
away
the
ninety
and
sixth
year
and
also
theninety
and
seventh
year
and
also
the
ninety
and
eighth
year
andalso
the
ninety
and
ninth
year
nephi


and
also
an
hundred
years
had
passed
away
since
the
days
ofmosiah
who
was
king
over
the
people
of
the
nephites
nephi


and
six
hundred
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
since
lehi
leftjerusalem
nephi


and
nine
years
had
passed
away
from
the
time
when
the
sign
wasgiven
which
was
spoken
of
by
the
prophets
that
christ
shouldcome
into
the
world
nephi


now
the
nephites
began
to
reckon
their
time
from
this
periodwhen
the
sign
was
given
or
from
the
coming
of
christ
thereforenine
years
had
passed
away
nephi


and
nephi
who
was
the
father
of
nephi
who
had
the
charge
ofthe
records
did
not
return
to
the
land
of
zarahemla
and
couldnowhere
be
found
in
all
the
land
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
did
still
remain
inwickedness
notwithstanding
the
much
preaching
and
prophesyingwhich
was
sent
among
them
and
thus
passed
away
the
tenth
yearalso
and
the
eleventh
year
also
passed
away
in
iniquity
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirteenth
year
there
began
to
bewars
and
contentions
throughout
all
the
land
for
the
gadiantonrobbers
had
become
so
numerous
and
did
slay
so
many
of
thepeople
and
did
lay
waste
so
many
cities
and
did
spread
so
muchdeath
and
carnage
throughout
the
land
that
it
became
expedientthat
all
the
people
both
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
shouldtake
up
arms
against
them
nephi


therefore
all
the
lamanites
who
had
become

unite
with
their
brethren
the

werecompelled
for
the
safety
of
their
lives

their
women
andtheir
children
to
take
up

against

also
to
maintain
their
rights
and
the
privileges
oftheir
church

of
their
worship

and
it
came
to
pass
that
before
this
thirteenth
year
hadpassed
away
the
nephites
were
threatened
with
utter
destructionbecause
of
this
war
which
had
become
exceedingly
sore

and
it
came
to
pass
that
those
lamanites
who
had
united
withthe
nephites
were
numbered
among
the
nephites
nephi


and
their
curse
was
taken
from
them
and
their
skin
becamewhite
like
unto
the
nephites
nephi


and
their
young
men
and
their
daughters
became
exceedinglyfair
and
they
were
numbered
among
the
nephites
and
were
callednephites

and
thus
ended

commencement
of

fourteenthyear
the
war
between
the

and
the
people

didcontinue
and
did
become
exceedingly
sore
nevertheless
thepeople

did
gain
some
advantage
of
the
robbers
insomuchthat
they
did
drive
them
back
out
of
their
lands
into
themountains
and
into
their
secret
places

and
thus
ended
the
fourteenth
year

and
in
the
fifteenthyear
they
did
come
forth
against
the

and
becauseof
the
wickedness
of
the
people
of

and
their
manycontentions
and
dissensions
the

did
gain

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
sixteenth
year
from
thecoming
of
christ
lachoneus
the
governor
of
the
land
receivedan
epistle
from
the
leader

ofrobbers
and
these
were
the

which
were
written
saying

lachoneus
most
noble
and
chief
governor
of

land
beholdI
write
this
epistle
unto
you
and
do
give
unto
you
exceedinglygreat
praise
because
of
your
firmness
and
also
the
firmness
ofyour

that
which
ye

and
it
seemeth
a
pity
unto

most
noble

that
yeshould
be
so
foolish
and
vain
as
to
suppose
that
ye
can
standagainst

many
brave
men
who
are
at

who
do
now
atthis
time
stand
in

therefore
if

because
of

therefore
I
write
unto
you
desiring
that
ye
would
yield
upunto
this
my
people
your
cities
your

and
yourpossessions
rather
than
that
they
should
visit
you
with

and
that
destruction
should
come
upon

or
in

words
yield
yourselves
up

if
ye
will
not

this
Iswear
unto

with
an
oath
that
on

I
willcommand
that
my

shall
come
down
against

and
theyshall
not
stay
their

shall
spare
not
but
shall
slayyou
and
shall
let
fall
the
sword
upon
you
even
until
ye
shallbecome
extinct
nephi


and
behold
I
am
giddianhi
and
I
am
the
governor
of
this
thesecret
society
of
gadianton
which
society
and
the
works
thereofI
know
to
be
good
and
they
are
of
ancient
date
and
they
havebeen
handed
down
unto
us
nephi


and
I
write
this
epistle
unto
you
lachoneus
and
I
hope
thatye
will
deliver
up
your
lands
and
your
possessions
without
theshedding
of
blood
that
this
my
people
may
recover
their
rightsand
government
who
have
dissented
away
from
you
because
of
yourwickedness
in
retaining
from
them
their
rights
of
government
andexcept
ye
do
this
I
will
avenge
their
wrongs

I
am
giddianhi
nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
when
lachoneus
received
this
epistlehe
was
exceedingly
astonished
because
of
the
boldness
ofgiddianhi
demanding
the
possession
of
the
land
of
the
nephitesand
also
of
threatening
the
people
and
avenging
the
wrongs
ofthose
that
had
received
no
wrong
save
it
were
they
had
wrongedthemselves
by
dissenting
away
unto
those
wicked
and
abominablerobbers
nephi


now
behold
this
lachoneus
the
governor
was
a
just
man
andcould
not
be
frightened
by
the
demands
and
the
threatenings
of
arobber
therefore
he
did
not
hearken
to
the
epistle
of
giddianhithe
governor
of
the
robbers
but
he
did
cause
that
his
peopleshould
cry
unto
the
lord
for
strength
against
the
time
that
therobbers
should
come
down
against
them
nephi


yea
he
sent
a
proclamation
among
all
the
people
that
theyshould
gather
together
their
women
and
their
children
theirflocks
and
their
herds
and
all
their
substance
save
it
weretheir
land
unto
one
place
nephi


and
he
caused
that
fortifications
should
be
built
round
aboutthem
and
the
strength
thereof
should
be
exceedingly
great

andhe
caused
that
armies
both
of
the
nephites
and
of
the
lamanitesor
of
all
them
who
were
numbered
among
the
nephites
should
beplaced
as
guards
round
about
to
watch
them
and
to
guard
themfrom
the
robbers
day
and
night
nephi


yea
he
said
unto
them
as
the
lord
liveth
except
ye
repentof
all
your
iniquities
and
cry
unto
the
lord
ye
will
in
no
wisebe
delivered
out
of
the
hands
of
those
gadianton
robbers
nephi


and
so
great
and
marvelous
were
the
words
and
prophecies
oflachoneus
that
they
did
cause
fear
to
come
upon
all
the
peopleand
they
did
exert
themselves
in
their
might
to
do
according
tothe
words
of
lachoneus
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
lachoneus
did
appoint
chief
captainsover
all
the
armies
of
the
nephites
to
command
them
at
the
timethat
the
robbers
should
come
down
out
of
the
wilderness
againstthem
nephi


now
the
chiefest
among
all
the
chief
captains
and
the
greatcommander
of
the
armies
of
the
nephites
was
appointed
and
hisname
was
gidgiddoni
nephi


now
it
was
the
custom
among
all
the
nephites
to
appoint
fortheir
chief
captains
save
it
were
in
their
times
of
wickednesssome
one
that
had
the
spirit
of
revelation
and
also
prophecytherefore
this
gidgiddoni
was
a
great
prophet
among
them
asalso
was
the
chief
judge
nephi


now
the
people
said
unto
gidgiddoni
pray
unto
the
lord
andlet
us
go
up
upon
the
mountains
and
into
the
wilderness
that
wemay
fall
upon
the
robbers
and
destroy
them
in
their
own
lands
nephi


but
gidgiddoni
saith
unto
them
the
lord
forbid
for
if
weshould
go
up
against
them
the
lord
would
deliver
us
into
theirhands
therefore
we
will
prepare
ourselves
in
the
center
of
ourlands
and
we
will
gather
all
our
armies
together
and
we
willnot
go
against
them
but
we
will
wait
till
they
shall
comeagainst
us
therefore
as
the
lord
liveth
if
we
do
this
he
willdeliver
them
into
our
hands
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventeenth
year
in
the
latterend
of
the
year
the
proclamation
of
lachoneus
had
gone
forththroughout
all
the
face
of
the
land
and
they
had
taken
theirhorses
and
their
chariots
and
their
cattle
and
all
theirflocks
and
their
herds
and
their
grain
and
all
theirsubstance
and
did
march
forth
by
thousands
and
by
tens
ofthousands
until
they
had
all
gone
forth
to
the
place
which
hadbeen
appointed
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
todefend
themselves
against
their
enemies
nephi


and
the
land
which
was
appointed
was
the
land
of
zarahemlaand
the
land
which
was
between
the
land
zarahemla

and
the
landbountiful
yea
to
the
line
which
was
between
the
land
bountifuland
the
land
desolation
nephi


and
there
were
a
great
many
thousand
people
who
were
callednephites
who
did
gather
themselves
together
in
this
land

nowlachoneus
did
cause
that
they
should
gather
themselves
togetherin
the
land
southward
because
of
the
great
curse
which
was
uponthe
land
northward
nephi


and
they
did
fortify
themselves
against
their
enemies
andthey
did
dwell
in
one
land
and
in
one
body
and
they
did
fearthe
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
lachoneus
insomuch
that
theydid
repent
of
all
their
sins
and
they
did
put
up
their
prayersunto
the
lord
their
god
that
he
would
deliver
them
in
the
timethat
their
enemies
should
come
down
against
them
to
battle
nephi


and
they
were
exceedingly
sorrowful
because
of
their
enemiesand
gidgiddoni
did
cause
that
they
should
make
weapons
of
war
ofevery
kind
and
they
should
be
strong
with
armor
and
withshields
and
with
bucklers
after
the
manner
of
his
instruction
nephi
chapter

nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
latter
end
of
the
eighteenthyear
those
armies
of
robbers
had
prepared
for
battle
and
beganto
come
down
and
to
sally
forth
from
the
hills
and
out
of
themountains
and
the
wilderness
and
their
strongholds
and
theirsecret
places
and
began
to
take
possession
of
the
lands
bothwhich
were
in
the
land
south
and
which
were
in
the
land
northand
began
to
take
possession
of
all
the
lands
which
had
beendeserted
by
the
nephites
and
the
cities
which
had
been
leftdesolate
nephi


but
behold
there
were
no
wild
beasts
nor
game
in
those
landswhich
had
been
deserted
by
the
nephites
and
there
was
no
gamefor
the
robbers
save
it
were
in
the
wilderness
nephi


and
the
robbers
could
not
exist
save
it
were
in
thewilderness
for
the
want
of
food
for
the
nephites
had
left
theirlands
desolate
and
had
gathered
their
flocks
and
their
herds
andall
their
substance
and
they
were
in
one
body
nephi


therefore
there
was
no
chance
for
the
robbers
to
plunder
andto
obtain
food
save
it
were
to
come
up
in
open
battle
againstthe
nephites
and
the
nephites
being
in
one
body
and
having
sogreat
a
number
and
having
reserved
for
themselves
provisionsand
horses
and
cattle
and
flocks
of
every
kind
that
they
mightsubsist
for
the
space
of
seven
years
in
the
which
time
they
didhope
to
destroy
the
robbers
from
off
the
face
of
the
land
andthus
the
eighteenth
year
did
pass
away
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
nineteenth
year
giddianhifound
that
it
was
expedient
that
he
should
go
up
to
battleagainst
the
nephites
for
there
was
no
way
that
they
couldsubsist
save
it
were
to
plunder
and
rob
and
murder
nephi


and
they
durst
not
spread
themselves
upon
the
face
of
the
landinsomuch
that
they
could
raise
grain
lest
the
nephites
shouldcome
upon
them
and
slay
them
therefore
giddianhi
gavecommandment
unto
his
armies
that
in
this
year
they
should
go
upto
battle
against
the
nephites
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
up
to
battle
and
itwas
in
the
sixth
month
and
behold
great
and
terrible
was
theday
that
they
did
come
up
to
battle
and
they
were
girded
aboutafter
the
manner
of
robbers
and
they
had
a
lambskin
about
theirloins
and
they
were
dyed
in
blood
and
their
heads
were
shornand
they
had
headplates
upon
them
and
great
and
terrible
wasthe
appearance
of
the
armies
of
giddianhi
because
of
theirarmor
and
because
of
their
being
dyed
in
blood
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
nephites
when
theysaw
the
appearance
of
the
army
of
giddianhi
had
all
fallen
tothe
earth
and
did
lift
their
cries
to
the
lord
their
god
thathe
would
spare
them
and
deliver
them
out
of
the
hands
of
theirenemies
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
armies
of
giddianhi
saw
thisthey
began
to
shout
with
a
loud
voice
because
of
their
joy
forthey
had
supposed
that
the
nephites
had
fallen
with
fear
becauseof
the
terror
of
their
armies
nephi


but
in
this
thing
they
were
disappointed
for
the
nephitesdid
not
fear
them
but
they
did
fear
their
god
and
did
supplicatehim
for
protection
therefore
when
the
armies
of
giddianhi
didrush
upon
them
they
were
prepared
to
meet
them
yea
in
thestrength
of
the
lord
they
did
receive
them
nephi


and
the
battle
commenced
in
this
the
sixth
month
and
greatand
terrible
was
the
battle
thereof
yea
great
and
terrible
wasthe
slaughter
thereof
insomuch
that
there
never
was
known
sogreat
a
slaughter
among
all
the
people
of
lehi
since
he
leftjerusalem
nephi


and
notwithstanding
the
threatenings
and
the
oaths
whichgiddianhi
had
made
behold
the
nephites
did
beat
them
insomuchthat
they
did
fall
back
from
before
them
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
gidgiddoni
commanded
that
his
armiesshould
pursue
them
as
far
as
the
borders
of
the
wilderness
andthat
they
should
not
spare
any
that
should
fall
into
their
handsby
the
way
and
thus
they
did
pursue
them
and
did
slay
them
tothe
borders
of
the
wilderness
even
until
they
had
fulfilled
thecommandment
of
gidgiddoni
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
giddianhi
who
had
stood
and
foughtwith
boldness
was
pursued
as
he
fled
and
being
weary
because
ofhis
much
fighting
he
was
overtaken
and
slain

and
thus
was
theend
of
giddianhi
the
robber
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
nephites
didreturn
again
to
their
place
of
security

and
it
came
to
passthat
this
nineteenth
year
did
pass
away
and
the
robbers
did
notcome
again
to
battle
neither
did
they
come
again
in
thetwentieth
year
nephi


and
in
the
twenty
and
first
year
they
did
not
come
up
tobattle
but
they
came
up
on
all
sides
to
lay
siege
round
aboutthe
people
of
nephi
for
they
did
suppose
that
if
they
should
cutoff
the
people
of
nephi
from
their
lands
and
should
hem
them
inon
every
side
and
if
they
should
cut
them
off
from
all
theiroutward
privileges
that
they
could
cause
them
to
yieldthemselves
up
according
to
their
wishes
nephi


now
they
had
appointed
unto
themselves
another
leader
whosename
was
zemnarihah
therefore
it
was
zemnarihah
that
did
causethat
this
siege
should
take
place
nephi


but
behold
this
was
an
advantage
to
the
nephites
for
it
wasimpossible
for
the
robbers
to
lay
siege
sufficiently
long
to
haveany
effect
upon
the
nephites
because
of
their
much
provisionwhich
they
had
laid
up
in
store
nephi


and
because
of
the
scantiness
of
provisions
among
therobbersfor
behold
they
had
nothing
save
it
were
meat
for
theirsubsistence
which
meat
they
did
obtain
in
the
wilderness
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
wild
game
became
scarce
in
thewildernessinsomuch
that
the
robbers
were
about
to
perish
withhunger
nephi


and
the
nephites
were
continually
marching
out
by
day
and
bynight
and
falling
upon
their
armies
and
cutting
them
off
bythousands
and
by
tens
of
thousands
nephi


and
thus
it
became
the
desire
of
the
people
of
zemnarihah
towithdraw
from
their
design
because
of
the
great
destructionwhich
came
upon
them
by
night
and
by
day
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
zemnarihah
did
give
command
unto
hispeople
that
they
should
withdraw
themselves
from
the
siege
andmarch
into
the
furthermost
parts
of
the
land
northward
nephi


and
now
gidgiddoni
being
aware
of
their
design
and
knowingof
their
weakness
because
of
the
want
of
food
and
the
greatslaughter
which
had
been
made
among
them
therefore
he
did
sendout
his
armies
in
the
nighttime
and
did
cut
off
the
way
oftheir
retreat
and
did
place
his
armies
in
the
way
of
theirretreat
nephi


and
this
did
they
do
in
the
nighttime
and
got
on
theirmarch
beyond
the
robbers
so
that
on
the
morrow
when
the
robbersbegan
their
march
they
were
met
by
the
armies
of
the
nephitesboth
in
their
front
and
in
their
rear
nephi


and
the
robbers
who
were
on
the
south
were
also
cut
off
intheir
places
of
retreat

and
all
these
things
were
done
bycommand
of
gidgiddoni
nephi


and
there
were
many
thousands
who
did
yield
themselves
upprisoners
unto
the
nephites
and
the
remainder
of
them
wereslain
nephi


and
their
leader
zemnarihah
was
taken
and
hanged
upon
atree
yea
even
upon
the
top
thereof
until
he
was
dead

and
whenthey
had
hanged
him
until
he
was
dead
they
did
fell
the
tree
tothe
earth
and
did
cry
with
a
loud
voice
saying
nephi


may
the
lord
preserve
his
people
in
righteousness
and
inholiness
of
heart
that
they
may
cause
to
be
felled
to
the
earthall
who
shall
seek
to
slay
them
because
of
power
and
secretcombinations
even
as
this
man
hath
been
felled
to
the
earth
nephi


and
they
did
rejoice
and
cry
again
with
one
voice
sayingmay
the
god
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
Isaac
and
the
god
ofjacob
protect
this
people
in
righteousness
so
long
as
theyshall
call
on
the
name
of
their
god
for
protection
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
break
forth
all
as
one
insinging
and
praising
their
god
for
the
great
thing
which
he
haddone
for
them
in
preserving
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
oftheir
enemies
nephi


yea
they
did
cry
hosanna
to
the
most
high
god

and
theydid
cry
blessed
be
the
name
of
the

god
almighty
the
mosthigh

and
their
hearts
were
swollen
with
joy
unto
the
gushing
outof
many
tears
because
of
the
great
goodness
of
god
in
deliveringthem
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
and
they
knew
it
wasbecause
of
their
repentance
and
their
humility

chapter

nephi


and
now
behold
there
was
not
a
living
soul
among
all
thepeople
of
the
nephites
who
did
doubt
in
the
least
the
words
ofall
the
holy
prophets
who
had
spoken
for
they
knew
that
it
mustneeds
be
that
they
must
be
fulfilled
nephi


and
they
knew
that
it
must
be
expedient
that
christ
had
comebecause
of
the
many
signs
which
had
been
given
according
to
thewords
of
the
prophets
and
because
of
the
things
which
had
cometo
pass
already
they
knew
that
it
must
needs
be
that
all
thingsshould
come
to
pass
according
to
that
which
had
been
spoken
nephi


therefore
they
did
forsake
all
their
sins
and
theirabominations
and
their
whoredoms
and
did
serve
god
with
alldiligence
day
and
night
nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
taken
all
therobbers
prisoners
insomuch
that
none
did
escape
who
were
notslain
they
did
cast
their
prisoners
into
prison
and
did
causethe
word
of
god
to
be
preached
unto
them
and
as
many
as
wouldrepent
of
their
sins
and
enter
into
a
covenant
that
they
wouldmurder
no
more
were
set
at
liberty
nephi


but
as
many
as
there
were
who
did
not
enter
into
a
covenantand
who
did
still
continue
to
have
those
secret
murders
in
theirhearts
yea
as
many
as
were
found
breathing
out
threateningsagainst
their
brethren
were
condemned
and
punished
according
tothe
law
nephi


and
thus
they
did
put
an
end
to
all
those
wicked
and
secretand
abominable
combinations
in
the
which
there
was
so
muchwickedness
and
so
many
murders
committed
nephi


and
thus
had
the
twenty
and
second
year
passed
away
and
thetwenty
and
third
year
also
and
the
twenty
and
fourth
and
thetwenty
and
fifth
and
thus
had
twenty
and
five
years
passed
away
nephi


and
there
had
many
things
transpired
which
in
the
eyes
ofsome
would
be
great
and
marvelous
nevertheless
they
cannot
allbe
written
in
this
book
yea
this
book
cannot
contain
even
ahundredth
part
of
what
was
done
among
so
many
people
in
the
spaceof
twenty
and
five
years
nephi


but
behold
there
are
records
which
do
contain
all
theproceedings
of
this
people
and
a
shorter
but
true
account
wasgiven
by
nephi
nephi


therefore
I
have
made
my
record
of
these
things
according
tothe
record
of
nephi
which
was
engraven
on
the
plates
which
werecalled
the
plates
of
nephi
nephi


and
behold
I
do
make
the
record
on
plates
which
I
have
madewith
mine
own
hands
nephi


and
behold
I
am
called
mormon
being
called
after
the
landof
mormon
the
land
in
which
alma
did
establish
the
church
amongthe
people
yea
the
first
church
which
was
established
amongthem
after
their
transgression
nephi


behold
I
am
a
disciple
of
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god

Ihave
been
called
of
him
to
declare
his
word
among
his
peoplethat
they
might
have
everlasting
life
nephi


and
it
hath
become
expedient
that
I
according
to
the
will
ofgod
that
the
prayers
of
those
who
have
gone
hence
who
were
theholy
ones
should
be
fulfilled
according
to
their
faith
shouldmake
a
record
of
these
things
which
have
been
done
nephi


yea
a
small
record
of
that
which
hath
taken
place
from
thetime
that
lehi
left
jerusalem
even
down
until
the
present
time
nephi


therefore
I
do
make
my
record
from
the
accounts
which
havebeen
given
by
those
who
were
before
me
until
the
commencement
ofmy
day
nephi


and
then
I
do
make
a
record
of
the
things
which
I
have
seenwith
mine
own
eyes
nephi


and
I
know
the
record
which
I
make
to
be
a
just
and
a
truerecord
nevertheless
there
are
many
things
which
according
toour
language
we
are
not
able
to
write
nephi


and
now
I
make
an
end
of
my
saying
which
is
of
myself
andproceed
to
give
my
account
of
the
things
which
have
been
beforeme
nephi


I
am
mormon
and
a
pure
descendant
of
lehi

I
have
reason
tobless
my
god
and
my
savior
jesus
christ
that
he
brought
ourfathers
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
and
no
one
knew
it
save
itwere
himself
and
those
whom
he
brought
out
of
that
land
and
thathe
hath
given
me
and
my
people
so
much
knowledge
unto
thesalvation
of
our
souls
nephi


surely
he
hath
blessed
the
house
of
jacob
and
hath
beenmerciful
unto
the
seed
of
joseph
nephi


and
insomuch
as
the
children
of
lehi
have
kept
hiscommandments
he
hath
blessed
them
and
prospered
them
according
tohis
word
nephi


yea
and
surely
shall
he
again
bring
a
remnant
of
the
seed
ofjoseph
to
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
their
god
nephi


and
as
surely
as
the
lord
liveth
will
he
gather
in
from
thefour
quarters
of
the
earth
all
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
jacobwho
are
scattered
abroad
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
nephi


and
as
he
hath
covenanted
with
all
the
house
of
jacob
evenso
shall
the
covenant
wherewith
he
hath
covenanted
with
the
houseof
jacob
be
fulfilled
in
his
own
due
time
unto
the
restoring
allthe
house
of
jacob
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
covenant
that
hehath
covenanted
with
them
nephi


and
then
shall
they
know
their
redeemer
who
is
jesus
christthe
son
of
god
and
then
shall
they
be
gathered
in
from
the
fourquarters
of
the
earth
unto
their
own
lands
from
whence
they
havebeen
dispersed
yea
as

so
shall

nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
the
nephites
didall
return
to
their
own
lands
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
everyman
with
his
family
his
flocks
and
his
herds
his
horses
andhis
cattle
and
all
things
whatsoever
did
belong
unto
them
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
had
not
eaten
up
all
theirprovisions
therefore
they
did
take
with
them
all
that
they
hadnot
devoured
of
all
their
grain
of
every
kind
and
their
goldand
their
silver
and
all
their
precious
things
and
they
didreturn
to
their
own
lands
and
their
possessions
both
on
thenorth
and
on
the
south
both
on
the
land
northward
and
on
theland
southward
nephi


and
they
granted
unto
those
robbers
who
had
entered
into
acovenant
to
keep
the
peace
of
the
land
who
were
desirous
toremain
lamanites
lands
according
to
their
numbers
that
theymight
have
with
their
labors
wherewith
to
subsist
upon
andthus
they
did
establish
peace
in
all
the
land
nephi


and
they
began
again
to
prosper
and
to
wax
great
and
thetwenty
and
sixth
and
seventh
years
passed
away
and
there
wasgreat
order
in
the
land
and
they
had
formed
their
laws
accordingto
equity
and
justice
nephi


and
now
there
was
nothing
in
all
the
land
to
hinder
the
peoplefrom
prospering
continually
except
they
should
fall
intotransgression
nephi


and
now
it
was
gidgiddoni
and
the
judge
lachoneus
and
thosewho
had
been
appointed
leaders
who
had
established
this
greatpeace
in
the
land
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
cities
built
anewand
there
were
many
old
cities
repaired
nephi


and
there
were
many
highways
cast
up
and
many
roads
madewhich
led
from
city
to
city
and
from
land
to
land
and
fromplace
to
place
nephi


and
thus
passed
away
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
and
thepeople
had
continual
peace
nephi


but
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
there
beganto
be
some
disputings
among
the
people
and
some
were
lifted
upunto
pride
and
boastings
because
of
their
exceedingly
greatriches
yea
even
unto
great
persecutions
nephi


for
there
were
many
merchants
in
the
land
and
also
manylawyers
and
many
officers
nephi


and
the
people
began
to
be
distinguished
by
ranks
accordingto
their
riches
and
their
chances
for
learning
yea
some
wereignorant
because
of
their
poverty
and
others
did
receive
greatlearning
because
of
their
riches
nephi


some
were
lifted
up
in
pride
and
others
were
exceedinglyhumble
some
did
return
railing
for
railing
while
others
wouldreceive
railing
and
persecution
and
all
manner
of
afflictionsand
would
not
turn
and
revile
again
but
were
humble
and
penitentbefore
god
nephi


and
thus
there
became
a
great
inequality
in
all
the
landinsomuch
that
the
church
began
to
be
broken
up
yea
insomuchthat
in
the
thirtieth
year
the
church
was
broken
up
in
all
theland
save
it
were
among
a
few
of
the
lamanites
who
were
convertedunto
the
true
faith
and
they
would
not
depart
from
it
for
theywere
firm
and
steadfast
and
immovable
willing
with
alldiligence
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
lord
nephi


now
the
cause
of
this
iniquity
of
the
people
was
thissatanhad
great
power
unto
the
stirring
up
of
the
people
to
do
allmanner
of
iniquity
and
to
the
puffing
them
up
with
pridetempting
them
to
seek
for
power
and
authority
and
riches
andthe
vain
things
of
the
world
nephi


and
thus
satan
did
lead
away
the
hearts
of
the
people
to
doall
manner
of
iniquity
therefore
they
had
enjoyed
peace
but
afew
years
nephi


and
thus
in
the
commencement
of
the
thirtieth
yearthepeople
having
been
delivered
up
for
the
space
of
a
long
time
tobe
carried
about
by
the
temptations
of
the
devil
whithersoever
hedesired
to
carry
them
and
to
do
whatsoever
iniquity
he
desiredthey
shouldand
thus
in
the
commencement
of
this
the
thirtiethyear
they
were
in
a
state
of
awful
wickedness
nephi


now
they
did
not
sin
ignorantly
for
they
knew
the
will
ofgod
concerning
them
for
it
had
been
taught
unto
them
thereforethey
did
wilfully
rebel
against
god
nephi


and
now
it
was
in
the
days
of
lachoneus
the
son
oflachoneus
for
lachoneus
did
fill
the
seat
of
his
father
and
didgovern
the
people
that
year
nephi


and
there
began
to
be
men
inspired
from
heaven
and
sentforth
standing
among
the
people
in
all
the
land
preaching
andtestifying
boldly
of
the
sins
and
iniquities
of
the
people
andtestifying
unto
them
concerning
the
redemption
which
the
lordwould
make
for
his
people
or
in
other
words
the
resurrection
ofchrist
and
they
did
testify
boldly
of
his
death
and
sufferings
nephi


now
there
were
many
of
the
people
who
were
exceedingly
angrybecause
of
those
who
testified
of
these
things
and
those
whowere
angry
were
chiefly
the
chief
judges
and
they
who
had
beenhigh
priests
and
lawyers
yea
all
those
who
were
lawyers
wereangry
with
those
who
testified
of
these
things
nephi


now
there
was
no
lawyer
nor
judge
nor
high
priest
that
couldhave
power
to
condemn
any
one
to
death
save
their
condemnationwas
signed
by
the
governor
of
the
land
nephi


now
there
were
many
of
those
who
testified
of
the
thingspertaining
to
christ
who
testified
boldly
who
were
taken
and
putto
death
secretly
by
the
judges
that
the
knowledge
of
theirdeath
came
not
unto
the
governor
of
the
land
until
after
theirdeath
nephi


now
behold
this
was
contrary
to
the
laws
of
the
land
thatany
man
should
be
put
to
death
except
they
had
power
from
thegovernor
of
the
land
nephi


therefore
a
complaint
came
up
unto
the
land
of
zarahemla
tothe
governor
of
the
land
against
these
judges
who
had
condemnedthe
prophets
of
the
lord
unto
death
not
according
to
the
law
nephi


now
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
taken
and
brought
upbefore
the
judge
to
be
judged
of
the
crime
which
they
had
doneaccording
to
the
law
which
had
been
given
by
the
people
nephi


now
it
came
to
pass
that
those
judges
had
many
friends
andkindreds
and
the
remainder
yea
even
almost
all
the
lawyers
andthe
high
priests
did
gather
themselves
together
and
unite
withthe
kindreds
of
those
judges
who
were
to
be
tried
according
tothe
law
nephi


and
they
did
enter
into
a
covenant
one
with
another
yeaeven
into
that
covenant
which
was
given
by
them
of
old
whichcovenant
was
given
and
administered
by
the
devil
to
combineagainst
all
righteousness
nephi


therefore
they
did
combine
against
the
people
of
the
lordand
enter
into
a
covenant
to
destroy
them
and
to
deliver
thosewho
were
guilty
of
murder
from
the
grasp
of
justice
which
wasabout
to
be
administered
according
to
the
law
nephi


and
they
did
set
at
defiance
the
law
and
the
rights
of
theircountry
and
they
did
covenant
one
with
another
to
destroy
thegovernor
and
to
establish
a
king
over
the
land
that
the
landshould
no
more
be
at
liberty
but
should
be
subject
unto
kings
nephi
chapter

nephi


now
behold
I
will
show
unto
you
that
they
did
not
establish
aking
over
the
land
but
in
this
same
year
yea
the
thirtiethyear
they
did
destroy
upon
the
judgment
seat
yea
did
murderthe
chief
judge
of
the
land
nephi


and
the
people
were
divided
one
against
another
and
they
didseparate
one
from
another
into
tribes
every
man
according
to
hisfamily
and
his
kindred
and
friends
and
thus
they
did
destroy
thegovernment
of
the
land
nephi


and
every
tribe
did
appoint
a
chief
or
a
leader
over
them
andthus
they
became
tribes
and
leaders
of
tribes
nephi


now
behold
there
was
no
man
among
them
save
he
had
muchfamily
and
many
kindreds
and
friends
therefore
their
tribesbecame
exceedingly
great
nephi


now
all
this
was
done
and
there
were
no
wars
as
yet
amongthem
and
all
this
iniquity
had
come
upon
the
people
because
theydid
yield
themselves
unto
the
power
of
satan
nephi


and
the
regulations
of
the
government
were
destroyed
becauseof
the
secret
combination
of
the
friends
and
kindreds
of
thosewho
murdered
the
prophets
nephi


and
they
did
cause
a
great
contention
in
the
land
insomuchthat
the
more
righteous
part
of
the
people
had
nearly
all
becomewicked
yea
there
were
but
few
righteous
men
among
them
nephi


and
thus
six
years
had
not
passed
away
since
the
more
part
ofthe
people
had
turned
from
their
righteousness
like
the
dog
tohis
vomit
or
like
the
sow
to
her
wallowing
in
the
mire
nephi


now
this
secret
combination
which
had
brought
so
greatiniquity
upon
the
people
did
gather
themselves
together
and
didplace
at
their
head
a
man
whom
they
did
call
jacob
nephi


and
they
did
call
him
their
king
therefore
he
became
a
kingover
this
wicked
band
and
he
was
one
of
the
chiefest
who
hadgiven
his
voice
against
the
prophets
who
testified
of
jesus
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
not
so
strong
in
number
asthe
tribes
of
the
people
who
were
united
together
save
it
weretheir
leaders
did
establish
their
laws
every
one
according
tohis
tribe
nevertheless
they
were
enemies
notwithstanding
theywere
not
a
righteous
people
yet
they
were
united
in
the
hatredof
those
who
had
entered
into
a
covenant
to
destroy
thegovernment
nephi


therefore
jacob
seeing
that
their
enemies
were
more
numerousthan
they
he
being
the
king
of
the
band
therefore
he
commandedhis
people
that
they
should
take
their
flight
into
thenorthernmost
part
of
the
land
and
there
build
up
unto
themselvesa
kingdom
until
they
were
joined
by
dissenters
for
heflattered
them
that
there
would
be
many
dissenters
and
theybecome
sufficiently
strong
to
contend
with
the
tribes
of
thepeople
and
they
did
so
nephi


and
so
speedy
was
their
march
that
it
could
not
be
impededuntil
they
had
gone
forth
out
of
the
reach
of
the
people

andthus
ended
the
thirtieth
year
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
thepeople
of
nephi
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirty
and
first
year
that
theywere
divided
into
tribes
every
man
according
to
his
familykindred
and
friends
nevertheless
they
had
come
to
an
agreementthat
they
would
not
go
to
war
one
with
another
but
they
were
notunited
as
to
their
laws
and
their
manner
of
government
for
theywere
established
according
to
the
minds
of
those
who
were
theirchiefs
and
their
leaders

but
they
did
establish
very
strictlaws
that
one
tribe
should
not
trespass
against
another
insomuchthat
in
some
degree
they
had
peace
in
the
land
neverthelesstheir
hearts
were
turned
from
the
lord
their
god
and
they
didstone
the
prophets
and
did
cast
them
out
from
among
them
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephihaving
been
visited
by
angelsand
also
the
voice
of
the
lord
therefore
having
seen
angels
andbeing
eyewitness
and
having
had
power
given
unto
him
that
hemight
know
concerning
the
ministry
of
christ
and
also
beingeyewitness
to
their
quick
return
from
righteousness
unto
theirwickedness
and
abominations
nephi


therefore
being
grieved
for
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
andthe
blindness
of
their
mindswent
forth
among
them
in
that
sameyear
and
began
to
testify
boldly
repentance
and
remission
ofsins
through
faith
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
nephi


and
he
did
minister
many
things
unto
them
and
all
of
themcannot
be
written
and
a
part
of
them
would
not
sufficetherefore
they
are
not
written
in
this
book

and
nephi
didminister
with
power
and
with
great
authority
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
angry
with
him
evenbecause
he
had
greater
power
than
they
for
it
were
not
possiblethat
they
could
disbelieve
his
words
for
so
great
was
his
faithon
the
lord
jesus
christ
that
angels
did
minister
unto
him
daily
nephi


and
in
the
name
of
jesus
did
he
cast
out
devils
and
uncleanspirits
and
even
his
brother
did
he
raise
from
the
dead
afterhe
had
been
stoned
and
suffered
death
by
the
people
nephi


and
the
people
saw
it
and
did
witness
of
it
and
were
angrywith
him
because
of
his
power
and
he
did
also
do
many
moremiracles
in
the
sight
of
the
people
in
the
name
of
jesus
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
thirty
and
first
year
did
passaway
and
there
were
but
few
who
were
converted
unto
the
lordbut
as
many
as
were
converted
did
truly
signify
unto
the
peoplethat
they
had
been
visited
by
the
power
and
spirit
of
god
whichwas
in
jesus
christ
in
whom
they
believed
nephi


and
as
many
as
had
devils
cast
out
from
them
and
were
healedof
their
sicknesses
and
their
infirmities
did
truly
manifestunto
the
people
that
they
had
been
wrought
upon
by
the
spirit
ofgod
and
had
been
healed
and
they
did
show
forth
signs
also
anddid
do
some
miracles
among
the
people
nephi


thus
passed
away
the
thirty
and
second
year
also

and
nephidid
cry
unto
the
people
in
the
commencement
of
the
thirty
andthird
year
and
he
did
preach
unto
them
repentance
and
remissionof
sins
nephi


now
I
would
have
you
to
remember
also
that
there
were
nonewho
were
brought
unto
repentance
who
were
not
baptized
withwater
nephi


therefore
there
were
ordained
of
nephi
men
unto
thisministry
that
all
such
as
should
come
unto
them
should
bebaptized
with
water
and
this
as
a
witness
and
a
testimony
beforegod
and
unto
the
people
that
they
had
repented
and
received
aremission
of
their
sins
nephi


and
there
were
many
in
the
commencement
of
this
year
thatwere
baptized
unto
repentance
and
thus
the
more
part
of
the
yeardid
pass
away
nephi
chapter

nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
according
to
our
record
and
weknow
our
record
to
be
true
for
behold
it
was
a
just
man
who
didkeep
the
recordfor
he
truly
did
many
miracles
in
the
name
ofjesus
and
there
was
not
any
man
who
could
do
a
miracle
in
thename
of
jesus
save
he
were
cleansed
every
whit
from
hisiniquity
nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
if
there
was
no
mistake
made
by
thisman
in
the
reckoning
of
our
time
the
thirty
and
third
year
hadpassed
away
nephi


and
the
people
began
to
look
with
great
earnestness
for
thesign
which
had
been
given
by
the
prophet
samuel
the
lamaniteyea
for
the
time
that
there
should
be
darkness
for
the
space
ofthree
days
over
the
face
of
the
land
nephi


and
there
began
to
be
great
doubtings
and
disputations
amongthe
people
notwithstanding
so
many
signs
had
been
given
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirty
and
fourth
year
in
thefirst
month
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
month
there
arose
a
greatstorm
such
an
one
as
never
had
been
known
in
all
the
land
nephi


and
there
was
also
a
great
and
terrible
tempest
and
there
wasterrible
thunder
insomuch
that
it
did
shake
the
whole
earth
asif
it
was
about
to
divide
asunder
nephi


and
there
were
exceedingly
sharp
lightnings
such
as
never
hadbeen
known
in
all
the
land
nephi


and
the
city
of
zarahemla
did
take
fire
nephi


and
the
city
of
moroni
did
sink
into
the
depths
of
the
seaand
the
inhabitants
thereof
were
drowned
nephi


and
the
earth
was
carried
up
upon
the
city
of
moronihah
thatin
the
place
of
the
city
there
became
a
great
mountain
nephi


and
there
was
a
great
and
terrible
destruction
in
the
landsouthward
nephi


but
behold
there
was
a
more
great
and
terrible
destructionin
the
land
northward
for
behold
the
whole
face
of
the
land
waschanged
because
of
the
tempest
and
the
whirlwinds
and
thethunderings
and
the
lightnings
and
the
exceedingly
great
quakingof
the
whole
earth
nephi


and
the
highways
were
broken
up
and
the
level
roads
werespoiled
and
many
smooth
places
became
rough
nephi


and
many
great
and
notable
cities
were
sunk
and
many
wereburned
and
many
were
shaken
till
the
buildings
thereof
hadfallen
to
the
earth
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
were
slain
andthe
places
were
left
desolate
nephi


and
there
were
some
cities
which
remained
but
the
damagethereof
was
exceedingly
great
and
there
were
many
of
them
whowere
slain
nephi


and
there
were
some
who
were
carried
away
in
the
whirlwindand
whither
they
went
no
man
knoweth
save
they
know
that
theywere
carried
away
nephi


and
thus
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
became
deformed
becauseof
the
tempests
and
the
thunderings
and
the
lightnings
and
thequaking
of
the
earth
nephi


and
behold
the
rocks
were
rent
in
twain
they
were
broken
upupon
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
insomuch
that
they
were
foundin
broken
fragments
and
in
seams
and
in
cracks
upon
all
theface
of
the
land
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
thunderings
and
thelightnings
and
the
storm
and
the
tempest
and
the
quakings
ofthe
earth
did
ceasefor
behold
they
did
last
for
about
thespace
of
three
hours
and
it
was
said
by
some
that
the
time
wasgreater
nevertheless
all
these
great
and
terrible
things
weredone
in
about
the
space
of
three
hoursand
then
behold
therewas
darkness
upon
the
face
of
the
land
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
thick
darkness
upon
allthe
face
of
the
land
insomuch
that
the
inhabitants
thereof
whohad
not
fallen
could
feel
the
vapor
of
darkness
nephi


and
there
could
be
no
light
because
of
the
darkness
neithercandles
neither
torches
neither
could
there
be
fire
kindledwith
their
fine
and
exceedingly
dry
wood
so
that
there
could
notbe
any
light
at
all
nephi


and
there
was
not
any
light
seen
neither
fire
nor
glimmerneither
the
sun
nor
the
moon
nor
the
stars
for
so
great
werethe
mists
of
darkness
which
were
upon
the
face
of
the
land
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
it
did
last
for
the
space
of
threedays
that
there
was
no
light
seen
and
there
was
great
mourningand
howling
and
weeping
among
all
the
people
continually
yeagreat
were
the
groanings
of
the
people
because
of
the
darknessand
the
great
destruction
which
had
come
upon
them
nephi


and
in
one
place
they
were
heard
to
cry
saying
o
that
wehad
repented
before
this
great
and
terrible
day
and
then
wouldour
brethren
have
been
spared
and
they
would
not
have
beenburned
in
that
great
city
zarahemla
nephi


and
in
another
place
they
were
heard
to

and
mournsaying
o
that
we
had

and
now
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
all
the
people
of
theland
did
hear
these
sayings
and
did
witness
of
it

and
afterthese
sayings
there
was
silence
in
the
land
for
the
space
of
manyhours
nephi


for
so
great
was
the
astonishment
of
the
people
that
they
didcease
lamenting
and
howling
for
the
loss
of
their
kindred
whichhad
been
slain
therefore
there
was
silence
in
all
the
land
forthe
space
of
many
hours
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
came
a
voice
again
unto
thepeople
and
all
the
people
did
hear
and
did
witness
of
itsaying
nephi


o
ye
people
of
these
great
cities
which
have
fallen
who
aredescendants
of
jacob
yea
who
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
howoft
have
I
gathered
you
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
herwings
and
have
nourished
you
nephi


and
again
how
oft
would
I
have
gathered
you
as
a
hengathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings
yea
o
ye
people
of
thehouse
of
Israel
who
have
fallen
yea
o
ye
people
of
the
houseof
Israel
ye
that
dwell
at
jerusalem
as
ye
that
have
fallenyea
how
oft
would
I
have
gathered
you
as
a
hen
gathereth
herchickens
and
ye
would
not
nephi


o
ye
house
of
Israel
whom
I
have
spared
how
oft
will
I
gatheryou
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings
if
ye
willrepent
and
return
unto
me
with
full
purpose
of
heart
nephi


but
if
not
o
house
of
Israel
the
places
of
your
dwellingsshall
become
desolate
until
the
time
of
the
fulfilling
of
thecovenant
to
your
fathers
nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
people
had
heard
thesewords
behold
they
began
to
weep
and
howl
again
because
of
theloss
of
their
kindred
and
friends
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
did
the
three
days
pass
away
and
it
was
in
the
morning
and
the
darkness
dispersed
from
offthe
face
of
the
land
and
the
earth
did
cease
to
tremble
and
therocks
did
cease
to
rend
and
the
dreadful
groanings
did
ceaseand
all
the
tumultuous
noises
did
pass
away
nephi


and
the
earth
did
cleave
together
again
that
it
stood
andthe
mourning
and
the
weeping
and
the
wailing
of
the
people
whowere
spared
alive
did
cease
and
their
mourning
was
turned
intojoy
and
their
lamentations
into
the
praise
and
thanksgiving
untothe
lord
jesus
christ
their
redeemer
nephi


and
thus
far
were
the
scriptures
fulfilled
which
had
beenspoken
by
the
prophets
nephi


and
it
was
the
more
righteous
part
of
the
people
who
weresaved
and
it
was
they
who
received
the
prophets
and
stoned
themnot
and
it
was
they
who
had
not
shed
the
blood
of
the
saintswho
were
spared
nephi


and
they
were
spared
and
were
not
sunk
and
buried
up
in
theearth
and
they
were
not
drowned
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
andthey
were
not
burned
by
fire
neither
were
they
fallen
upon
andcrushed
to
death
and
they
were
not
carried
away
in
thewhirlwind
neither
were
they
overpowered
by
the
vapor
of
smokeand
of
darkness
nephi


and
now
whoso
readeth
let
him
understand
he
that
hath
thescriptures
let
him
search
them
and
see
and
behold
if
all
thesedeaths
and
destructions
by
fire
and
by
smoke
and
by
tempestsand
by
whirlwinds
and
by
the
opening
of
the
earth
to
receivethem
and
all
these
things
are
not
unto
the
fulfilling
of
theprophecies
of
many
of
the
holy
prophets
nephi


behold
I
say
unto
you
yea
many
have
testified
of
thesethings
at
the
coming
of
christ
and
were
slain
because
theytestified
of
these
things
nephi


yea
the
prophet
zenos
did
testify
of
these
things
and
alsozenock
spake
concerning
these
things
because
they
testifiedparticularly
concerning
us
who
are
the
remnant
of
their
seed
nephi


behold
our
father
jacob
also
testified
concerning
a
remnantof
the
seed
of
joseph

and
behold
are
not
we
a
remnant
of
theseed
of
joseph

and
these
things
which
testify
of
us
are
theynot
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass
which
our
father
lehibrought
out
of
jerusalem
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
ending
of
the
thirty
andfourth
year
behold
I
will
show
unto
you
that
the
people
ofnephi
who
were
spared
and
also
those
who
had
been
calledlamanites
who
had
been
spared
did
have
great
favors
shown
untothem
and
great
blessings
poured
out
upon
their
heads
insomuchthat
soon
after
the
ascension
of
christ
into
heaven
he
did
trulymanifest
himself
unto
them
nephi


showing
his
body
unto
them
and
ministering
unto
them
and
anaccount
of
his
ministry
shall
be
given
hereafter

therefore
forthis
time
I
make
an
end
of
my
sayings
nephi
chapter

nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
a
great
multitudegathered
together
of
the
people
of
nephi
round
about
the
templewhich
was
in
the
land
bountiful
and
they
were
marveling
andwondering
one
with
another
and
were
showing
one
to
another
thegreat
and
marvelous
change
which
had
taken
place
nephi


and
they
were
also
conversing
about
this
jesus
christ
of
whomthe
sign
had
been
given
concerning
his
death
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
while
they
were
thus
conversing
onewith
another
they
heard
a
voice
as
if
it
came
out
of
heaven
andthey
cast
their
eyes
round
about
for
they
understood
not
thevoice
which
they
heard
and
it
was
not
a
harsh
voice
neither
wasit
a
loud
voice
nevertheless
and
notwithstanding
it
being
asmall
voice
it
did
pierce
them
that
did
hear
to
the
centerinsomuch
that
there
was
no
part
of
their
frame
that
it
did
notcause
to
quake
yea
it
did
pierce
them
to
the
very
soul
and
didcause
their
hearts
to
burn
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
again
they
heard
the
voice
and
theyunderstood
it
not
nephi


and
again
the
third
time
they
did
hear
the
voice
and
did
opentheir
ears
to
hear
it
and
their
eyes
were
towards
the
soundthereof
and
they
did
look
steadfastly
towards
heaven
fromwhence
the
sound
came
nephi


and
behold
the
third
time
they
did
understand
the
voice
whichthey
heard
and
it
said
unto
them
nephi


behold
my
beloved
son
in
whom
I
am
well
pleased
in
whom
Ihave
glorified
my
namehear
ye
him
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
as
they
understood
they
cast
their
eyesup
again
towards
heaven
and
behold
they
saw
a
man
descendingout
of
heaven
and
he
was
clothed
in
a
white
robe
and
he
camedown
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
them
and
the
eyes
of
the
wholemultitude
were
turned
upon
him
and
they
durst
not
open
theirmouths
even
one
to
another
and
wist
not
what
it
meant
for
theythought
it
was
an
angel
that
had
appeared
unto
them
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
spakeunto
the
people
saying
nephi


behold
I
am
jesus
christ
whom
the
prophets
testified
shallcome
into
the
world
nephi


and
behold
I
am
the
light
and
the
life
of
the
world
and
Ihave
drunk
out
of
that
bitter
cup
which
the
father
hath
given
meand
have
glorified
the
father
in
taking
upon
me
the
sins
of
theworld
in
the
which
I
have
suffered
the
will
of
the
father
in
allthings
from
the
beginning
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
wordsthe
whole
multitude
fell
to
the
earth
for
they
remembered
thatit
had
been
prophesied
among
them
that
christ
should
show
himselfunto
them
after
his
ascension
into
heaven
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
spake
unto
them
saying
nephi


arise
and
come
forth
unto
me
that
ye
may
thrust
your
handsinto
my
side
and
also
that
ye
may
feel
the
prints
of
the
nailsin
my
hands
and
in
my
feet
that
ye
may
know
that
I
am
the
god
ofIsrael
and
the
god
of
the
whole
earth
and
have
been
slain
forthe
sins
of
the
world
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
multitude
went
forth
and
thrusttheir
hands
into
his
side
and
did
feel
the
prints
of
the
nailsin
his
hands
and
in
his
feet
and
this
they
did
do
going
forthone
by
one
until
they
had
all
gone
forth
and
did
see
with
theireyes
and
did
feel
with
their
hands
and
did
know
of
a
surety
anddid
bear
record
that
it
was
he
of
whom
it
was
written
by
theprophets
that
should
come
nephi


and
when
they
had
all
gone
forth
and
had
witnessed
forthemselves
they
did
cry
out
with
one
accord
saying
nephi


hosanna

blessed
be
the
name
of
the
most
high
god

and
theydid
fall
down
at
the
feet
of
jesus
and
did
worship
him
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
nephi
for
nephi
wasamong
the
multitude
and
he
commanded
him
that
he
should
comeforth
nephi


and
nephi
arose
and
went
forth
and
bowed
himself
before
thelord
and
did
kiss
his
feet
nephi


and
the
lord
commanded
him
that
he
should
arise

and
hearose
and
stood
before
him
nephi


and
the
lord
said
unto
him

people
when

and
again
the
lord
called
others
and
said
unto
themlikewise
and
he
gave
unto
them

he
saidunto

that

looketh
on
a
woman
tolust
after

nephi


behold
I
give
unto
you
a
commandment
that
ye
suffer
none
ofthese
things
to
enter
into
your
heart
nephi


for
it
is
better
that
ye
should
deny
yourselves
of
thesethings
wherein
ye
will
take
up
your
cross
than
that
ye
shouldbe
cast
into
hell

It
hath
been
written
that
whosoever

him
give

causeth
her
tocommit
adultery

whoso
shall
marry
her
who

divorcedcommitteth
adultery
nephi


and
again
it
is
written
thou
shalt
not
forswear
thyself
butshalt
perform
unto
the
lord
thine
oaths
nephi


but
verily
verily
I
say
unto
you
swear
not
at
all
neitherby
heaven
for
it
is
gods
throne
nephi


nor
by
the
earth
for
it
is
his
footstool
nephi


neither
shalt
thou
swear
by
thy
head
because
thou
canst
notmake
one
hair
black
or
white
nephi


but
let
your
communication
be
yea
yea
nay
nay
forwhatsoever
cometh
of
more
than
these
is
evil
nephi


and
behold
it
is
written
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
fora
tooth
nephi


but
I
say
unto
you
that
ye
shall
not
resist
evil
butwhosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
thy
right
cheek
turn
to
him
theother
also
nephi


and
if
any
man
will
sue
thee
at
the
law
and
take
away
thycoat
let
him
have
thy
cloak
also
nephi


and
whosoever
shall
compel
thee
to
go
a
mile
go
with
himtwain
nephi


give
to
him
that
asketh
thee
and
from
him
that
would
borrowof
thee
turn
not
away
nephi


and
behold
it
is
written
also
that
thou
shalt
love
thyneighbor
and
hate
thine
enemy
nephi


but
I
say
unto
you
love
your
enemies
bless
them
that
curseyou
do
good
to
them
that
hate
you
and
pray
for
them
whodespitefully
use
you
and
persecute
you
nephi


that
ye
may
be
the
children
of
your
father
who
is
in
heavenfor
he
maketh
his
sun
to
rise
on
the
evil
and
on
the
good
nephi


therefore
those
things
which
were
of
old
time
which
wereunder
the
law
in
me
are
all
fulfilled
nephi


old
things
are
done
away
and
all
things
have
become
new
nephi


therefore
I
would
that
ye
should
be
perfect
even
as

nephi


verily
verily
I
say
that
I
would
that
ye
should
do
alms
untothe
poor
but
take
heed
that
ye
do
not
your
alms
before
men
to
beseen
of
them
otherwise
ye
have
no
reward
of
your
father
who
isin
heaven
nephi


therefore
when
ye
shall
do
your
alms
do
not
sound
a
trumpetbefore
you
as
will
hypocrites
do
in
the
synagogues
and
in
thestreets
that
they
may
have
glory
of
men

verily
I
say
unto
youthey
have
their
reward
nephi


but
when
thou
doest
alms
let
not
thy
left
hand
know
what
thyright
hand
doeth
nephi


that
thine
alms
may
be
in
secret
and
thy
father
who
seeth
insecret
himself
shall
reward
thee
openly
nephi


and
when
thou
prayest
thou
shalt
not
do
as
the
hypocrites
forthey
love
to
pray
standing
in
the
synagogues
and
in
the
cornersof
the
streets
that
they
may
be
seen
of
men

verily
I
say
untoyou
they
have
their
reward
nephi


but
thou
when
thou
prayest
enter
into
thy
closet
and
whenthou
hast
shut
thy
door
pray
to
thy
father
who
is
in
secret
andthy
father
who
seeth
in
secret
shall
reward
thee
openly
nephi


but
when
ye
pray
use
not
vain
repetitions
as
the
heathenfor
they
think
that
they
shall
be
heard
for
their
much
speaking
nephi


be
not
ye
therefore
like
unto
them
for
your
father
knowethwhat
things
ye
have
need
of
before
ye
ask
him
nephi


after
this
manner
therefore
pray
ye
our
father
who
art
inheaven
hallowed
be
thy
name
nephi


thy
will
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
nephi


and
forgive
us
our
debts
as
we
forgive
our
debtors
nephi


and
lead
us
not
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
from
evil
nephi


for
thine
is
the
kingdom
and
the
power
and
the
gloryforever

amen
nephi


for
if
ye
forgive
men
their
trespasses
your
heavenly
fatherwill
also
forgive
you
nephi


but
if
ye
forgive
not
men
their
trespasses
neither
will
yourfather
forgive
your
trespasses
nephi


moreover
when
ye
fast
be
not
as
the
hypocrites
of
a
sadcountenance
for
they
disfigure
their
faces
that
they
may
appearunto
men
to
fast

verily
I
say
unto
you
they
have
their
reward
nephi


but
thou
when
thou
fastest
anoint
thy
head
and
wash
thyface
nephi


that
thou
appear
not
unto
men
to
fast
but
unto
thy
fatherwho
is
in

thy

who
seeth
in

lay
not
up

yourselves
treasures
upon

where

up
for

in

where
neithermoth

where
thieves
do
not

for
where
your

is
there
will
your

be
also
nephi


the
light
of
the
body
is
the
eye
if
therefore
thine
eye
besingle
thy
whole

shall
be
full
of

but
if
thine

be

thy
whole

If
therefore
the

great
is
that
darkness
nephi


no
man
can
serve
two
masters
for
either
he
will
hate
the
oneand
love
the
other
or
else
he
will
hold
to
the
one
and
despisethe
other

ye
cannot
serve
god
and
mammon
nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
thesewords
he
looked
upon
the
twelve
whom
he
had
chosen
and
said
untothem
remember
the
words
which
I
have
spoken

for
behold
ye
arethey
whom
I
have
chosen
to
minister
unto
this
people

thereforeI
say
unto
you
take
no
thought
for
your
life
what
ye
shall
eator
what
ye
shall
drink
nor
yet
for
your
body
what
ye
shall
puton

Is
not
the
life
more
than
meat
and
the
body
than
raiment
nephi


behold
the
fowls
of
the
air
for
they
sow
not
neither
dothey
reap
nor
gather
into
barns
yet
your
heavenly
father
feedeththem

are
ye
not
much
better
than
they
nephi


which
of
you
by
taking
thought
can
add
one
cubit
unto
hisstature
nephi


and
why
take
ye
thought
for
raiment

consider
the
lilies
ofthe
field
how
they
grow
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
nephi


and
yet
I
say
unto
you
that
even
solomon
in
all
his
glorywas
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these
nephi


wherefore
if
god
so
clothe
the
grass
of
the
field
whichtoday
is
and
tomorrow
is
cast
into
the
oven
even
so
will
heclothe
you
if
ye
are
not
of
little
faith
nephi


therefore
take
no
thought
saying
what
shall
we
eat

orwhat
shall
we
drink

or
wherewithal
shall
we
be
clothed
nephi


for
your
heavenly
father
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
allthese
things
nephi


but
seek
ye
first
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousnessand
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you
nephi


take
therefore
no
thought
for
the

for
the

take

for
the

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
wordshe
turned
again
to
the
multitude
and
did
open
his
mouth
untothem
again
saying

verily
I

unto

for
with
what
judgment
ye

ye

judged
and
withwhat
measure
ye
mete
it
shall
be
measured
to

and
why
beholdest
thou
the
mote
that
is

considerest
not

let

pull

thou
hypocrite
first
cast

out
of

andthen
shalt
thou
see
clearly
to
cast
the
mote
out

give
not
that

unto

neither
cast

they
trample

it
shall
be
given
unto

ye

it

for
every

that

he
that

to
him
that

what

is
there
of

who
if
his

ask
bread
willgive
him
a
stone
nephi


or
if
he
ask
a

will
he
give

a

If
ye
then
being

know
how
to
give
good

unto
yourchildren
how
much
more
shall
your

who

givegood

therefore
all
things
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
doto
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
for
this
is
the
law

enter
ye
in
at
the
strait
gate
for
wide
is
the
gate
andbroad
is
the
way
which
leadeth
to

and
many
there
bewho

because
strait
is
the
gate
and
narrow
is
the
way
whichleadeth
unto
life
and
few
there
be
that
find
it
nephi


beware
of
false
prophets
who
come
to
you
in
sheepsclothing
but
inwardly
they
are
ravening
wolves
nephi


ye
shall
know
them
by
their
fruits

do
men
gather
grapes
ofthorns

figs
of
thistles

even
so
every
good

bringeth
forth

a

every

that

then
will
I

therefore
whoso
heareth

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
ended
thesesayings
he
cast
his
eyes
round
about
on
the
multitude
and
saidunto
them
behold
ye
have
heard
the
things
which
I
taught
beforeI
ascended
to
my
father
therefore
whoso
remembereth
thesesayings
of
mine
and
doeth
them
him
will
I
raise
up
at
the
lastday
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
said
these
words
heperceived
that
there
were
some
among
them
who
marveled
andwondered
what
he
would
concerning
the
law
of
moses
for
theyunderstood
not
the
saying
that
old
things
had
passed
away
andthat
all
things
had
become
new
nephi


and
he
said
unto
them
marvel
not
that
I
said
unto
you
thatold
things
had
passed
away
and
that
all
things
had
become
new
nephi


behold
I
say
unto
you
that
the
law
is
fulfilled
that
wasgiven
unto
moses
nephi


behold
I
am
he
that
gave
the
law
and
I
am
he
who
covenantedwith
my
people
Israel
therefore
the
law
in
me
is
fulfilled
forI
have
come
to
fulfil
the
law
therefore
it
hath
an
end
nephi


behold
I
do
not
destroy
the
prophets
for
as
many
as
have
notbeen
fulfilled
in
me
verily
I
say
unto
you
shall
all
befulfilled
nephi


and
because
I
said
unto
you
that
old
things
have
passed
awayI
do
not
destroy
that
which
hath
been
spoken
concerning
thingswhich
are
to
come
nephi


for
behold
the
covenant
which
I
have
made
with
my

and
this

the
prophets
forthey
truly
testified
of

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
thesewords
he
said
unto
those
twelve
whom
he
had
chosen
nephi


ye
are
my
disciples
and
ye
are
a
light
unto
this
people
whoare
a
remnant
of
the
house
of
joseph
nephi


and
behold
this
is
the
land
of
your
inheritance
and
thefather
hath
given
it
unto
you
nephi


and
not
at
any
time
hath
the
father
given
me
commandment
thatI
should
tell
it
unto
your
brethren
at
jerusalem
nephi


neither
at
any
time
hath
the
father
given
me
commandment
thatI
should
tell
unto
them
concerning
the
other
tribes
of
the
houseof
Israel
whom
the
father
hath
led
away
out
of
the
land
nephi


this
much
did
the
father
command
me
that
I
should
tell
untothem
nephi


that
other
sheep
I
have
which
are
not
of

fold
them
alsoI
must
bring
and
they
shall
hear
my
voice
and
there
shall
beone
fold
and
one
shepherd
nephi


and
now
because
of
stiffneckedness
and
unbelief
theyunderstood
not
my
word
therefore
I
was
commanded
to
say
no
moreof
the
father
concerning
this
thing
unto
them
nephi


but
verily
I
say
unto
you
that
the
father
hath
commandedme
and
I
tell
it
unto
you
that
ye
were
separated
from

because
of
their
iniquity
therefore
it
is
because
of
theiriniquity
that
they
know
not
of
you
nephi


and
verily
I
say
unto
you
again
that
the
other
tribes
haththe
father
separated

and
it
is
because
of
theiriniquity

them
also
I
mustbring
and
they
shall
hear
my
voice
and
there
shall
be
one
foldand
one
shepherd
nephi


and
they
understood
me
not
for
they
supposed
it
had
been
thegentiles
for
they
understood
not
that
the
gentiles
should
beconverted
through
their
preaching
nephi


and
they
understood
me
not
that
I
said

that
ye
cannot
understand
all
mywords
which
I
am
commanded
of
the

to
speak
unto

atthis
time

therefore
go
ye
unto
your

and
ponder
upon
the
thingswhich

but
now
I
go
unto

are
not
lost
unto
the

casthis

round
about

on

and
beheld

and
did
look
steadfastly
upon
him
as
if
they
would
askhim
to
tarry
a
little
longer
with

nephi


and
he
said
unto
them

have
done
unto
your

at
jerusalem
for
I
see
that
yourfaith
is
sufficient
that
I
should
heal
you

and
it
came
to

that
when
he
had
thus
spoken
all
themultitude
with
one
accord
did
go
forth
with
their

and
they
did
all

they
who

and
they
whowere
whole

and
did
worship

and
asmany
as

insomuchthat
they
did

end
ofpraying
unto

he
arose
but
so
great
was
the

the
multitude
and
saidunto

any
man
from

unto
you
when
ye
shall
meet
togetherbut
suffer
them
that
they
may
come
unto

and
forbid

not
nephi


but
ye
shall
pray
for
them
and
shall
not
cast
them
out
andif
it
so
be
that
they
come
unto

oft

behold
ye
see
that
I
have
prayed
unto
thefather
and
ye
all
have
witnessed
nephi


and
ye
see
that
I
have
commanded
that
none
of

should
goaway
but
rather

commanded
that
ye
should
come
unto
me
thatye
might
feel
and
see
even
so
shall
ye
do
unto
the
world
andwhosoever
breaketh
this
commandment
suffereth
himself
to
be
ledinto

and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
thesewords
he
turned
his
eyes
again
upon
the
disciples
whom
he
hadchosen
and
said
unto
them
nephi


behold
verily
verily
I
say
unto
you
I
give
unto

commandment
and
then
I
must
go
unto
my
father
that
I
mayfulfil
other
commandments
which
he
hath
given
me
nephi


and
now
behold
this
is
the
commandment
which
I
give
untoyou
that
ye
shall
not
suffer
any
one
knowingly
to
partake
of
myflesh
and
blood
unworthily
when
ye
shall
minister
it
nephi


for
whoso
eateth
and
drinketh
my
flesh
and
blood
unworthilyeateth
and
drinketh
damnation
to
his
soul
therefore
if
ye
knowthat
a
man
is
unworthy
to
eat
and
drink
of
my
flesh
and
blood
yeshall
forbid
him
nephi


nevertheless
ye
shall
not
cast
him
out
from
among
you
butye
shall
minister
unto
him
and
shall
pray
for
him
unto
thefather
in
my
name
and
if
it
so
be
that
he
repenteth
and
isbaptized
in
my
name
then
shall
ye
receive
him
and
shallminister
unto
him
of
my
flesh
and
blood
nephi


but
if
he
repent
not
he
shall
not
be
numbered
among
mypeople
that
he
may
not
destroy
my
people
for
behold
I
know
mysheep
and
they
are
numbered
nephi


nevertheless
ye
shall
not
cast
him
out
of
your
synagoguesor
your
places
of
worship
for
unto
such
shall
ye
continue
tominister
for
ye
know
not
but
what
they
will
return
and
repentand
come
unto
me
with
full
purpose
of
heart
and
I
shall
healthem
and
ye
shall
be
the
means
of
bringing
salvation
unto
them
nephi


therefore
keep
these
sayings
which
I
have
commanded
you
thatye
come
not
under
condemnation
for
wo
unto
him
whom
the
fathercondemneth
nephi


and
I
give
you
these
commandments
because
of
the
disputationswhich
have
been
among
you

and
blessed
are
ye
if
ye
have
nodisputations
among
you
nephi


and
now
I
go
unto
the
father
because
it
is
expedient
that
Ishould
go
unto
the
father
for
your
sakes
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
made
an
end
of
thesesayings
he
touched
with
his
hand
the
disciples
whom
he
hadchosen
one
by
one
even
until
he
had
touched
them
all
and
spakeunto
them
as
he
touched
them
nephi


and
the
multitude
heard
not
the
words
which
he
spaketherefore
they
did
not
bear
record
but
the
disciples
bare
recordthat
he
gave
them
power
to
give
the
holy
ghost

and
I
will
showunto
you
hereafter
that
this
record
is
true
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
touched
them
allthere
came
a
cloud
and
overshadowed
the
multitude
that
they
couldnot
see
jesus
nephi


and
while
they
were
overshadowed
he
departed
from
them
andascended
into
heaven

and
the
disciples
saw
and
did
bear
recordthat
he
ascended
again
into
heaven

did
notmultiply
many
words
for
it
was
given
unto
them
what
they
shouldpray

blessed
them
as
they
did
prayunto
him
and
his
countenance
did
smile
upon

and
the
lightof

white
as

and
jesus
said
unto

they
did
notcease
to

nephi


and
he
turned
from

again
and
went
a
little
way
off
andbowed
himself
to
the
earth
and
he
prayed
again
unto
the

father
I
pray
not
for

out

because
of
their
faith
that
theymay
be
purified
in

unto
the
father

and
tongue
cannot
speak
the
words
which
he
prayed
neithercan
be
written
by
man
the
words
which
he
prayed
nephi


and
the
multitude
did
hear
and
do
bear
record
and
theirhearts
were
open
and
they
did
understand
in
their
hearts
thewords
which
he
prayed
nephi


nevertheless
so
great
and
marvelous
were
the
words
which
heprayed
that
they
cannot
be
written
neither
can
they
be
utteredby
man

and
it
came
to

that
when
jesus
had
made
an
end
ofpraying
he
came
again
to
the
disciples
and
said
unto
them
sogreat

surely
he
spake
as
touching
all
things
concerning
mypeople
which
are

therefore
it
must
needsbe
that
he
must
speak
also
to

all
things
that
he
spake
have
been
and
shall
be
evenaccording
to

he
spake

of
these
things
nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
said
these
wordshe
said
unto
them
again
after
he
had
expounded
all
thescriptures
unto
them
which
they
had
received
he
said
unto
thembehold
other
scriptures
I
would
that

not

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
nephi
bring
forth
therecord
which
ye
have
kept
nephi


and
when
nephi
had
brought
forth
the
records
and
laid
thembefore
him
he
cast
his
eyes
upon
them
and
said
nephi


verily
I
say
unto
you
I
commanded
my
servant
samuel
thelamanite
that
he
should
testify
unto
this
people
that
at
theday
that
the
father
should
glorify
his
name
in
me
that
there
weremany
saints
who
should
arise
from
the
dead
and
should
appearunto
many
and
should
minister
unto
them

and
he
said
unto
themwas
it
not
so
nephi


and
his
disciples
answered
him
and
said
yea
lord
samueldid
prophesy
according
to
thy
words
and
they
were
all
fulfilled
nephi


and
jesus
said
unto
them
how
be
it
that
ye
have
not
writtenthis
thing
that
many
saints
did
arise
and
appear
unto
many
anddid
minister
unto
them
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
remembered
that
this
thing
hadnot
been
written
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
jesus
commanded
that
it
should
bewritten
therefore
it
was
written
according
as
he
commanded
nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
expounded
all
thescriptures
in
one
which
they
had
written
he
commanded
them
thatthey
should
teach
the
things
which
he
had
expounded
unto
them
nephi
chapter

nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
commanded
them
that
they
shouldwrite
the
words
which
the
father
had
given
unto
malachi
which
heshould
tell
unto
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
werewritten
he
expounded
them

and
these
are
the
words
which
he
didtell
unto
them
saying
thus
said
the
father
untomalachibehold
I
will
send
my

nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
told
these
thingshe
expounded
them
unto
the
multitude
and
he
did
expound
allthings
unto
them
both
great
and
small
nephi


and
he
saith
these
scriptures
which
ye
had
not
with
you
thefather
commanded
that
I
should
give
unto
you
for
it
was
wisdomin
him
that
they
should
be
given
unto
future
generations
nephi


and
he
did
expound
all
things
even
from
the
beginning
untilthe
time
that
he
should
come
in
his
gloryyea
even
all
thingswhich
should
come
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
even
until
theelements
should
melt
with
fervent
heat
and
the
earth
should
bewrapt
together
as
a
scroll
and
the
heavens
and
the
earth
shouldpass
away

and
even
unto
the
great
and
last
day
when
all
people
and
allkindreds
and
all
nations
and
tongues
shall
stand
before
god
tobe
judged
of
their
works
whether
they
be
good
or
whether
they
beevil
nephi


If
they
be
good
to
the
resurrection
of
everlasting
life
andif
they
be
evil
to
the
resurrection
of
damnation
being
on
aparallel
the
one
on
the
one
hand
and
the
other
on
the
otherhand
according
to
the
mercy
and
the
justice
and
the
holinesswhich
is
in
christ
who
was
before
the
world
began
nephi


and
now
there
cannot
be
written
in
this
book
even
a
hundredthpart
of
the
things
which
jesus
did
truly
teach
unto
the
people
nephi


but
behold
the
plates
of
nephi
do
contain
the
more
part
of
thethings
which
he
taught
the
people
nephi


and
these
things
have
I
written
which
are
a
lesser
part
ofthe
things
which
he
taught
the
people
and
I
have
written
them
tothe
intent
that
they
may
be
brought
again
unto
this
people
fromthe
gentiles
according
to
the
words
which
jesus
hath
spoken
nephi


and
when
they
shall
have
received
this
which
is
expedientthat
they
should
have
first
to
try
their
faith
and
if
it
shallso
be
that
they
shall
believe
these
things
then
shall
the
greaterthings
be
made
manifest
unto
them
nephi


and
if
it
so
be
that
they
will
not
believe
these
things
thenshall
the
greater
things
be
withheld
from
them
unto
theircondemnation
nephi


behold
I
was
about
to
write
them
all
which
were
engravenupon
the
plates
of
nephi
but
the
lord
forbade
it
saying
I
willtry
the
faith
of
my
people
nephi


therefore
I
mormon
do
write
the
things
which
have
beencommanded
me
of
the
lord

and
now
I
mormon
make
an
end
of
mysayings
and
proceed
to
write
the
things
which
have
beencommanded
me
nephi


therefore
I
would
that
ye
should
behold
that
the
lord
trulydid
teach
the
people
for
the
space
of
three
days
and
after
thathe
did
show
himself
unto
them
oft
and
did
break
bread
oft
andbless
it
and
give
it
unto
them
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
teach
and
minister
unto
thechildren
of
the
multitude
of
whom
hath
been
spoken
and
he
didloose
their
tongues
and
they
did
speak
unto
their
fathers
greatand
marvelous
things
even
greater
than
he
had
revealed
unto
thepeople
and
he
loosed
their
tongues
that
they
could
utter
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
ascended
intoheaventhe
second
time
that
he
showed
himself
unto
them
and
hadgone
unto
the
father
after
having
healed
all
their
sick
andtheir
lame
and
opened
the
eyes
of
their
blind
and
unstopped
theears
of
the
deaf
and
even
had
done
all
manner
of
cures
amongthem
and
raised
a
man
from
the
dead
and
had
shown
forth
hispower
unto
them
and
had
ascended
unto
the
father
nephi


behold
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
that
the
multitudegathered
themselves
together
and
they
both
saw
and
heard
thesechildren
yea
even
babes
did
open
their
mouths
and
uttermarvelous
things
and
the
things
which
they
did
utter
wereforbidden
that
there
should
not
any
man
write
them
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
disciples
whom
jesus
had
chosenbegan
from
that
time
forth
to
baptize
and
to
teach
as
many
as
didcome
unto
them
and
as
many
as
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
jesuswere
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
nephi


and
many
of
them
saw
and
heard
unspeakable
things
which
arenot
lawful
to
be
written
nephi


and
they
taught
and
did
minister
one
to
another
and
theyhad
all
things
common
among
them
every
man
dealing
justly
onewith
another
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
do
all
things
even
as
jesushad
commanded
them
nephi


and
they
who
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
jesus
were
calledthe
church

nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
as
the
disciples
of
jesus
werejourneying
and
were
preaching
the
things
which
they
had
bothheard
and
seen
and
were
baptizing
in
the
name
of

it
cameto
pass
that
the
disciples
were
gathered
together
and
were
unitedin
mighty
prayer
and
fasting
nephi


and
jesus
again
showed
himself
unto
them
for
they
werepraying
unto
the
father
in
his
name
and
jesus
came
and
stood
inthe
midst
of
them
and
said
unto
them
what
will
ye
that
I
shallgive
unto
you
nephi


and
they
said
unto
him
lord
we
will
that
thou
wouldst
tellus
the
name
whereby
we
shall
call
this
church
for
there
aredisputations
among
the
people
concerning
this
matter
nephi


and
the
lord
said
unto
them
verily
verily
I
say
unto
youwhy
is
it
that
the
people
should
murmur
and
dispute
because
ofthis
thing
nephi


have
they
not
read
the
scriptures
which
say
ye
must
take
uponyou
the
name
of
christ
which
is
my
name

for
by
this
name
shallye
be
called
at
the
last
day
nephi


and
whoso
taketh
upon
him
my
name
and
endureth
to
the
endthe
same
shall
be
saved
at
the
last
day
nephi


therefore
whatsoever
ye
shall
do
ye
shall
do
it
in
my
nametherefore
ye
shall
call
the
church
in
my
name
and
ye
shall
callupon
the
father
in
my
name
that
he
will
bless
the
church
for
mysake
nephi


and
how
be
it
my
church
save
it
be
called
in
my
name

for
ifa
church
be
called
in
moses
name
then
it
be
moses
church
or
ifit
be
called
in
the
name
of
a

then
it
be
the
church
of
a
manbut
if
it
be
called
in
my
name
then
it
is
my
church
if
it
so
bethat
they
are
built
upon
my
gospel
nephi


verily
I
say
unto
you
that
ye
are
built
upon
my
gospeltherefore
ye
shall
call
whatsoever
things
ye
do
call
in
my
nametherefore
if
ye
call
upon
the
father
for
the
church
if
it
be
inmy
name
the
father
will
hear
you
nephi


and
if
it
so
be
that
the
church
is
built
upon
my
gospel
thenwill
the
father
show
forth
his
own
works
in
it
nephi


but
if
it
be
not
built
upon
my
gospel
and
is
built
upon
theworks
of
men
or
upon
the
works
of
the
devil
verily
I
say
untoyou
they
have
joy
in
their
works
for
a
season
and
by
and
by
theend
cometh
and
they
are
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
fromwhence
there
is
no
return
nephi


for
their
works
do
follow
them
for
it
is
because
of
theirworks
that
they
are
hewn
down
therefore
remember
the
things
thatI
have
told
you
nephi


behold
I
have
given
unto
you
my
gospel
and
this
is
thegospel
which
I
have
given
unto
youthat
I
came
into
the
world
todo
the
will
of
my
father
because
my
father
sent
me
nephi


and
my
father
sent
me
that
I
might
be
lifted
up
upon
thecross
and
after
that
I
had
been
lifted
up
upon
the
cross
that
Imight
draw
all
men
unto
me
that
as
I
have
been
lifted
up
by
meneven
so
should
men
be
lifted
up
by
the
father
to
stand
beforeme
to
be
judged
of
their
works
whether
they
be
good
or
whetherthey
be
evil
nephi


and
for
this
cause
have
I
been
lifted
up
thereforeaccording
to
the
power
of
the
father
I
will
draw
all
men
unto
methat
they
may
be
judged
according
to
their
works
nephi


and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whoso
repenteth
and
isbaptized
in
my
name
shall
be
filled
and
if
he
endureth
to
theend
behold
him
will
I
hold
guiltless
before
my
father
at
thatday
when
I
shall
stand
to
judge
the
world
nephi


and
he
that
endureth
not
unto
the
end
the
same
is
he
that
isalso
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
from
whence
they
can
nomore
return
because
of
the
justice
of
the
father
nephi


and
this
is
the
word
which
he
hath
given
unto
the
children
ofmen

and
for
this
cause
he
fulfilleth
the
words
which
he
hathgiven
and
he
lieth
not
but
fulfilleth
all
his
words
nephi


and
no
unclean
thing
can
enter
into
his
kingdom
thereforenothing
entereth
into
his
rest
save
it
be
those
who
have
washedtheir
garments
in
my
blood
because
of
their
faith
and
therepentance
of
all
their
sins
and
their
faithfulness
unto
theend
nephi


now
this
is
the
commandment
repent
all
ye
ends
of

but
behold

sorroweth
me
because
of
the
fourth
generationfrom
this
generation
for
they
are
led
away
captive
by
him
evenas
was
the
son
of
perdition
for
they
will
sell
me
for
silver

for
that

break
through

steal

and
it
came
to
pass
when
jesus
had
said
these
words
he
spakeunto
his
disciples
one
by
one
saying
unto
them
what
is
it
thatye
desire
of
me
after
that
I
am
gone
to
the
father
nephi


and
they
all
spake
save
it
were
three
saying
we
desire
thatafter
we
have
lived
unto
the
age
of
man
that
our
ministrywherein
thou
hast
called
us
may
have
an
end
that
we
mayspeedily
come
unto
thee
in

and
he
said
unto
them
blessed
are
ye
because
ye
desired
thisthing
of
me
therefore
after
that
ye
are
seventy
and
two
yearsold
ye
shall
come
unto

in

with

ye
shallfind

and
when
he
had
spoken
unto
them
he
turned
himself
unto
thethree
and
said
unto
them
what
will
ye
that
I
should
do
untoyou
when
I
am
gone
unto
the
father
nephi


and
they
sorrowed
in
their
hearts
for
they
durst
not
speakunto
him
the
things
which
they
desired
nephi


and
he
said
unto
them
behold
I
know
your
thoughts
and
yehave
desired
the
thing
which
john
my
beloved
who
was
with
me
inmy
ministry
before
that
I
was
lifted
up
by
the
jews
desired
ofme
nephi


therefore
more
blessed
are
ye
for
ye
shall
never
taste
ofdeath
but
ye
shall
live
to
behold
all
the
doings
of
the
fatherunto
the
children
of
men
even
until
all
things
shall
befulfilled
according
to
the
will
of
the
father
when
I
shall
comein
my
glory
with
the
powers
of
heaven

and
ye
shall
never
endure
the
pains
of
death
but
when
I
shallcome
in
my
glory
ye
shall
be
changed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eyefrom
mortality
to
immortality
and
then
shall
ye
be
blessed
inthe
kingdom
of
my
father
nephi


and
again
ye
shall
not
have
pain
while
ye
shall
dwell
in
theflesh
neither
sorrow
save
it
be
for
the
sins
of
the
world
andall
this
will
I
do
because
of
the
thing
which
ye
have
desired
ofme
for
ye
have
desired
that
ye
might
bring
the
souls
of
men
untome
while
the
world
shall
stand
nephi


and
for
this
cause
ye
shall
have
fulness
of
joy
and
ye
shallsit
down
in
the
kingdom
of
my
father
yea
your
joy
shall
befull
even
as
the
father
hath
given
me
fulness
of
joy

yeshall
be
even
as
I
am
and
I
am
even
as
the
father
and
thefather
and
I
are

nephi


and
the
holy
ghost
beareth
record
of
the
father
and
me
andthe
father
giveth
the
holy
ghost
unto
the
children
of
menbecause
of
me
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
jesus
had
spoken
these
wordshe
touched
every
one
of
them
with
his
finger
save
it
were
thethree
who
were
to
tarry
and
then
he
departed
nephi


and
behold
the
heavens
were
opened
and
they
were
caught
upinto
heaven
and
saw
and
heard
unspeakable
things
nephi


and
it
was
forbidden
them
that
they
should
utter
neither
wasit
given
unto
them
power
that
they
could
utter
the
things
whichthey
saw
and
heard
nephi


and
whether
they
were
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
theycould
not
tell
for
it
did
seem
unto
them
like
a
transfigurationof
them
that
they
were
changed
from
this
body
of
flesh
into
animmortal
state
that
they
could
behold
the
things
of
god
nephi


but
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
again
minister
upon
theface
of
the
earth
nevertheless
they
did
not
minister
of
thethings
which
they
had
heard
and
seen
because
of
the
commandmentwhich
was
given
them
in
heaven
nephi


and
now
whether
they
were
mortal
or
immortal
from
the
dayof
their
transfiguration
I
know
not
nephi


but
this
much
I
know
according
to
the
record
which
hath
beengiventhey
did
go
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
didminister
unto
all
the
people
uniting
as
many
to
the
church
aswould
believe
in
their
preaching
baptizing
them
and
as
many
aswere
baptized
did
receive
the
holy
ghost
nephi


and
they
were
cast
into
prison
by
them
who
did
not
belong
tothe
church
and
the
prisons
could
not
hold
them
for
they
wererent
in
twain
nephi


and
they
were
cast
down
into
the
earth
but
they
did
smitethe
earth
with
the
word
of
god
insomuch
that
by
his
power
theywere
delivered
out
of
the
depths
of
the
earth
and
therefore
theycould
not
dig
pits
sufficient
to
hold
them
nephi


and
thrice
they
were
cast
into
a
furnace
and
received
nohard
nephi


and
twice
were
they
cast
into
a
den
of
wild
beasts
andbehold
they
did
play
with
the
beasts
as
a
child
with
a
sucklinglamb
and
received
no
harm
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
they
did
go
forth
among
all
thepeople
of
nephi
and
did
preach
the
gospel
of
christ
unto
allpeople
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
they
were
converted
untothe
lord
and
were
united
unto
the
church
of
christ
and
thus
thepeople
of
that
generation
were
blessed
according
to
the
word
ofjesus
nephi


and
now
I
mormon
make
an
end
of
speaking
concerning
thesethings
for
a
time
nephi


behold
I
was
about
to
write
the
names
of
those
who
werenever
to
taste
of
death
but
the
lord
forbade
therefore
I
writethem
not
for
they
are
hid
from
the
world
nephi


but
behold
I
have
seen
them
and
they
have
ministered
untome
nephi


and
behold
they
will
be
among
the
gentiles
and
the
gentilesshall
know
them
not
nephi


they
will
also
be
among
the
jews
and
the
jews
shall
knowthem
not
nephi


and
it
shall
come
to
pass
when
the
lord
seeth
fit
in
hiswisdom
that
they
shall
minister
unto
all
the
scattered
tribes
ofIsrael
and
unto
all
nations
kindreds
tongues
and
people
andshall
bring
out
of
them
unto
jesus
many
souls
that
their
desiremay
be
fulfilled
and
also
because
of
the
convincing
power
of
godwhich
is
in
them
nephi


and
they
are
as
the
angels
of
god
and
if
they
shall
prayunto
the
father
in
the
name
of
jesus
they
can
show
themselvesunto
whatsoever
man
it
seemeth
them
good
nephi


therefore
great
and
marvelous
works
shall
be
wrought
bythem
before
the
great
and
coming
day
when
all
people
must
surelystand
before
the
judgmentseat
of
christ
nephi


yea
even
among
the
gentiles
shall
there
be
a
great
andmarvelous
work
wrought
by
them
before
that
judgment
day
nephi


and
if
ye
had
all
the
scriptures
which
give
an
account
of
allthe
marvelous
works
of
christ
ye
would
according
to
the
wordsof
christ
know
that
these
things
must
surely
come
nephi


and
wo
be
unto
him
that
will
not
hearken
unto
the
words
ofjesus
and
also
to
them
whom
he
hath
chosen
and
sent
among
themfor
whoso
receiveth
not
the
words
of
jesus
and
the
words
of
thosewhom
he
hath
sent
receiveth
not
him
and
therefore
he
will
notreceive
them
at
the
last
day
nephi


and
it
would
be
better
for
them
if
they
had
not
been
bornfor
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
can
get
rid
of
the
justice
of
anoffended
god
who
hath
been
trampled
under
feet
of
men
thatthereby
salvation
might
come
nephi


and
now
behold
as
I
spake
concerning
those
whom
the
lordhath
chosen
yea
even
three
who
were
caught
up
into
the
heavensthat
I
knew
not
whether
they
were
cleansed
from
mortality
toimmortality
nephi


but
behold
since
I
wrote
I
have
inquired
of
the
lord
andhe
hath
made
it
manifest
unto
me
that
there
must
needs
be
achange
wrought
upon
their
bodies
or
else
it
needs
be
that
theymust
taste
of
death
nephi


therefore
that
they
might
not
taste
of
death
there
was
achange
wrought
upon
their
bodies
that
they
might
not
suffer
painnor
sorrow
save
it
were
for
the
sins
of
the
world
nephi


now
this
change
was
not
equal
to
that
which
shall
take
placeat
the
last
day
but
there
was
a
change
wrought
upon
theminsomuch
that
satan
could
have
no
power
over
them
that
he
couldnot
tempt
them
and
they
were
sanctified
in
the
flesh
that
theywere
holy
and
that
the
powers
of
the
earth
could
not
hold
them
nephi


and
in
this
state
they
were
to
remain
until
the
judgment
dayof
christ
and
at
that
day
they
were
to
receive
a
greater
changeand
to
be
received
into
the
kingdom
of
the
father
to
go
no
moreout
but
to
dwell
eternally
in
the
heavens

I
say
unto

that
when
the
lord
shall
seefit
in
his
wisdom
that
these
sayings
shall
come
unto
thegentiles
according
to

then
ye
may
know

thecovenant
which
the

hath
made
with

their

ye
may
know

the
words

which
have
beenspoken

shall
all
be
fulfilled

ye
neednot

delays

and
ye
need
not
imagine
in

that
the

will
remember
hiscovenant
which
he
hath
made

and
when
ye
shall
see
these
sayings
coming
forth

ye
need
not
any
longer
spurn
at
the
doings
of
the

sword
of
his

right
hand

atthat
day
if
ye
shall
spurn

he
will
cause

spurneth
at

wo
unto

that

deny

that
shall

worketh
by

orby
prophecy
or
by

or
by

or
by
healings
or
bythe
power
of

and
wo
unto
him
that
shall
say
at
that
day
to
get
gainthat
there
can
be
no
miracle
wrought
by

for
he
thatdoeth
this
shall
become
like
unto
the
son
of

for
whomthere
was
no

to
the

ye
need
not

hear
and
all
manner
ofmiracles
did
they
work
among
the
children
of
men
and
in
nothingdid
they
work
miracles
save
it
were
in
the
name
of
jesus
nephi


and
thus
did
the
thirty
and
eighth
year
pass
away
and
alsothe
thirty
and
ninth
and
forty
and
first
and
the
forty
andsecond
yea
even
until
forty
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
andalso
the
fifty
and
first
and
the
fifty
and
second
yea
and
evenuntil
fifty
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
nephi


and
the
lord
did
prosper
them
exceedingly
in
the
land
yeainsomuch
that
they
did
build
cities
again
where
there
had
beencities
burned
nephi


yea
even
that
great
city
zarahemla
did
they
cause
to
be
builtagain
nephi


but
there
were
many
cities
which
had
been
sunk
and
waterscame
up
in
the
stead
thereof
therefore
these
cities
could
not
berenewed
nephi


and
now
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
nephi
didwax
strong
and
did
multiply
exceedingly
fast
and
became
anexceedingly
fair
and
delightsome
people
nephi


and
they
were
married
and
given
in
marriage
and
wereblessed
according
to
the
multitude
of
the
promises
which
the
lordhad
made
unto
them
nephi


and
they
did
not
walk
any
more
after
the
performances
andordinances
of
the
law
of
moses
but
they
did
walk
after
thecommandments
which
they
had
received
from
their
lord
and
theirgod
continuing
in
fasting
and
prayer
and
in
meeting
togetheroft
both
to
pray
and
to
hear
the
word
of
the
lord
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
no
contention
among
allthe
people
in
all
the
land
but
there
were
mighty
miracleswrought
among
the
disciples
of
jesus
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
seventy
and
first
year
passedaway
and
also
the
seventy
and
second
year
yea
and
in
finetill
the
seventy
and
ninth
year
had
passed
away
yea
even
anhundred
years
had
passed
away
and
the
disciples
of
jesus
whomhe
had
chosen
had
all
gone
to
the
paradise
of
god
save
it
werethe
three
who
should
tarry
and
there
were
other
disciplesordained
in
their
stead
and
also
many
of
that
generation
hadpassed
away
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
no
contention
in
the
landbecause
of
the
love
of
god
which
did
dwell
in
the
hearts
of
thepeople
nephi


and
there
were
no
envyings
nor
strifes
nor
tumults
norwhoredoms
nor
lyings
nor
murders
nor
any
manner
oflasciviousness
and
surely
there
could
not
be
a
happier
peopleamong
all
the
people
who
had
been
created
by
the
hand
of
god
nephi


there
were
no
robbers
nor
murderers
neither
were
therelamanites
nor
any
manner
of
ites
but
they
were
in
one
thechildren
of
christ
and
heirs
to
the
kingdom
of
god
nephi


and
how
blessed
were
they

for
the
lord
did
bless
them
inall
their
doings
yea
even
they
were
blessed
and
prospered
untilan
hundred
and
ten
years
had
passed
away
and
the
firstgeneration
from
christ
had
passed
away
and
there
was
nocontention
in
all
the
land
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
nephi
he
that
kept
this
lastrecord
and
he
kept
it
upon
the
plates
of
nephi
died
and
hisson
amos
kept
it
in
his
stead
and
he
kept
it
upon
the
plates
ofnephi
also
nephi


and
he
kept
it
eighty
and
four
years
and
there
was
stillpeace
in
the
land
save
it
were
a
small
part
of
the
people
whohad
revolted
from
the
church
and
taken
upon
them
the
name
oflamanites
therefore
there
began
to
be
lamanites
again
in
theland
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
amos
died
also
and
it
was
anhundred
and
ninety
and
four
years
from
the
coming
of
christ
andhis
son
amos
kept
the
record
in
his
stead
and
he
also
kept
itupon
the
plates
of
nephi
and
it
was
also
written
in
the
book
ofnephi
which
is
this
book
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
two
hundred
years
had
passed
awayand
the
second
generation
had
all
passed
away
save
it
were
a
few
nephi


and
now
I
mormon
would
that
ye
should
know
that
the
peoplehad
multiplied
insomuch
that
they
were
spread
upon
all
the
faceof
the
land
and
that
they
had
become
exceedingly
rich
becauseof
their
prosperity
in
christ
nephi


and
now
in
this
two
hundred
and
first
year
there
began
to
beamong
them
those
who
were
lifted
up
in
pride
such
as
the
wearingof
costly
apparel
and
all
manner
of
fine
pearls
and
of
the
finethings
of
the
world
nephi


and
from
that
time
forth
they
did
have
their
goods
and
theirsubstance
no
more
common
among
them
nephi


and
they
began
to
be
divided
into
classes
and
they
began
tobuild
up
churches
unto
themselves
to
get
gain
and
began
to
denythe
true
church
of
christ
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
two
hundred
and
ten
years
hadpassed
away
there
were
many
churches
in
the
land
yea
there
weremany
churches
which
professed
to
know
the
christ
and
yet
theydid
deny
the
more
parts
of
his
gospel
insomuch
that
they
didreceive
all
manner
of
wickedness
and
did
administer
that
whichwas
sacred
unto
him
to
whom
it
had
been
forbidden
because
ofunworthiness
nephi


and
this
church
did
multiply
exceedingly
because
of
iniquityand
because
of
the
power
of
satan
who
did
get
hold
upon
theirhearts
nephi


and
again
there
was
another
church
which
denied
the
christand
they
did
persecute
the
true
church
of
christ
because
oftheir
humility
and
their
belief
in
christ
and
they
did
despisethem
because
of
the
many
miracles
which
were
wrought
among
them
nephi


therefore
they
did
exercise
power
and
authority
over
thedisciples
of
jesus
who
did
tarry
with
them
and
they
did
castthem
into
prison
but
by
the
power
of
the
word
of
god
which
wasin
them
the
prisons
were
rent
in
twain
and
they
went
forthdoing
mighty
miracles
among
them
nephi


nevertheless
and
notwithstanding
all
these
miracles
thepeople
did
harden
their
hearts
and
did
seek
to
kill
them
evenas
the
jews
at
jerusalem
sought
to
kill
jesus
according
to
hisword
nephi


and
they
did
cast
them
into
furnaces
of
fire
and
they
cameforth
receiving
no
harm
nephi


and
they
also
cast
them
into
dens
of
wild
beasts
and
theydid
play
with
the
wild
beasts
even
as
a
child
with
a
lamb
andthey
did
come
forth
from
among
them
receiving
no
harm
nephi


nevertheless
the
people
did
harden
their
hearts
for
theywere
led
by
many
priests
and
false
prophets
to
build
up
manychurches
and
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity

and
they
did
smiteupon
the
people
of
jesus
but
the
people
of
jesus
did
not
smiteagain

and
thus
they
did
dwindle
in
unbelief
and
wickednessfrom
year
to
year
even
until
two
hundred
and
thirty
years
hadpassed
away
nephi


and
now
it
came
to
pass
in
this
year
yea
in
the
two
hundredand
thirty
and
first
year
there
was
a
great
division
among
thepeople
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
there
arose
a
peoplewho
were
called
the
nephites
and
they
were
true
believers
inchrist
and
among
them
there
were
those
who
were
called
by
thelamanitesjacobites
and
josephites
and
zoramites
nephi


therefore
the
true
believers
in
christ
and
the
trueworshipers
of
christ
among
whom
were
the
three
disciples
ofjesus
who
should
tarry
were
called
nephites
and
jacobites
andjosephites
and
zoramites
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
who
rejected
the
gospel
werecalled
lamanites
and
lemuelites
and
Ishmaelites
and
they
didnot
dwindle
in
unbelief
but
they
did
wilfully
rebel
against
thegospel
of
christ
and
they
did
teach
their
children
that
theyshould
not
believe
even
as
their
fathers
from
the
beginningdid
dwindle
nephi


and
it
was
because
of
the
wickedness
and
abomination
of
theirfathers
even
as
it
was
in
the
beginning

and
they
were
taughtto
hate
the
children
of
god
even
as
the
lamanites
were
taught
tohate
the
children
of
nephi
from
the
beginning
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
two
hundred
and
forty
and
four
yearshad
passed
away
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
the
people

andthe
more
wicked
part
of
the
people
did
wax
strong
and
becameexceedingly
more
numerous
than
were
the
people
of
god
nephi


and
they
did
still
continue
to
build
up
churches
untothemselves
and
adorn
them
with
all
manner
of
precious
things
and
thus
did
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
pass
away
and
also
twohundred
and
sixty
years
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
wicked
part
of
the
people
beganagain
to
build
up
the
secret
oaths
and
combinations
of
gadianton
nephi


and
also
the
people
who
were
called
the
people
of
nephi
beganto
be
proud
in
their
hearts
because
of
their
exceeding
richesand
become
vain
like
unto
their
brethren
the
lamanites
nephi


and
from
this
time
the
disciples
began
to
sorrow
for
the
sinsof
the
world
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
three
hundred
years
had
passedaway
both
the
people
of
nephi
and
the
lamanites
had
becomeexceedingly
wicked
one
like
unto
another
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
robbers
of
gadianton
did
spreadover
all
the
face
of
the
land
and
there
were
none
that
wererighteous
save
it
were
the
disciples
of
jesus

and
gold
andsilver
did
they
lay
up
in
store
in
abundance
and
did
traffic
inall
manner
of
traffic
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
three
hundred
and
five
yearshad
passed
away
and
the
people
did
still
remain
in
wickednessamos
died
and
his
brother
ammaron
did
keep
the
record
in
hisstead
nephi


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
three
hundred
and
twenty
yearshad
passed
away
ammaron
being
constrained
by
the
holy
ghostdid
hide
up
the
records
which
were
sacredyea
even
all
thesacred
records
which
had
been
handed
down
from
generation
togeneration
which
were
sacredeven
until
the
three
hundred
andtwentieth
year
from
the
coming
of
christ
nephi


and
he
did
hide
them
up
unto
the
lord
that
they
might
comeagain
unto
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
jacob
according
to
theprophecies
and
the
promises
of
the
lord

and
thus
is
the
end
ofthe
record
of
ammaronmormonthe
book
of
mormonmormon
chapter
mormon


and
now
I
mormon
make
a
record
of
the
things
which
I
haveboth
seen
and
heard
and
call
it
the
book
of
mormonmormon


and
about
the
time
that
ammaron
hid
up
the
records
unto
thelord
he
came
unto
me
I
being
about
ten
years
of
age
and
Ibegan
to
be
learned
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
the
learning
ofmy
people
and
ammaron
said
unto
me
I
perceive
that
thou
art
asober
child
and
art
quick
to
observemormon


therefore
when
ye
are
about
twenty
and
four
years
old
I
wouldthat
ye
should
remember
the
things
that
ye
have
observedconcerning
this
people
and
when
ye
are
of
that
age
go
to
theland
antum
unto
a
hill
which
shall
be
called
shim
and
therehave
I
deposited
unto
the
lord
all
the
sacred
engravingsconcerning
this
peoplemormon


and
behold
ye
shall
take
the
plates
of
nephi
unto
yourselfand
the
remainder
shall
ye
leave
in
the
place
where
they
are
andye
shall
engrave
on
the
plates
of
nephi
all
the
things
that
yehave
observed
concerning
this
peoplemormon


and
I
mormon
being
a
descendant
of
nephi
and
my
fathersname
was
mormon
I
remembered
the
things
which
ammaron
commandedmemormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
being
eleven
years
old
wascarried
by
my
father
into
the
land
southward
even
to
the
land
ofzarahemlamormon


the
whole
face
of
the
land
had
become
covered
with
buildingsand
the
people
were
as
numerous
almost
as
it
were
the
sand
ofthe
seamormon


and
it
came
to
pass
in
this
year
there
began
to
be
a
warbetween
the
nephites
who
consisted
of
the
nephites
and
thejacobites
and
the
josephites
and
the
zoramites
and
this
war
wasbetween
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites
and
the
lemuelites
andthe
Ishmaelitesmormon


now
the
lamanites
and
the
lemuelites
and
the
Ishmaelites
werecalled
lamanites
and
the
two
parties
were
nephites
andlamanitesmormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
war
began
to
be
among
them
inthe
borders
of
zarahemla
by
the
waters
of
sidonmormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
had
gathered
together
agreat
number
of
men
even
to
exceed
the
number
of
thirtythousand

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
have
in
this
sameyear
a
number
of
battles
in
which
the
nephites
did
beat
thelamanites
and
did
slay
many
of
themmormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
withdrew
their
designand
there
was
peace
settled
in
the
land
and
peace
did
remain
forthe
space
of
about
four
years
that
there
was
no
bloodshedmormon


but
wickedness
did
prevail
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
landinsomuch
that
the
lord
did
take
away
his
beloved
disciples
andthe
work
of
miracles
and
of
healing
did
cease
because
of
theiniquity
of
the
peoplemormon


and
there
were
no
gifts
from
the
lord
and
the
holy
ghost
didnot
come
upon
any
because
of
their
wickedness
and
unbeliefmormon


and
I
being
fifteen
years
of
age
and
being
somewhat
of
asober
mind
therefore
I
was
visited
of
the
lord
and
tasted
andknew
of
the
goodness
of
jesusmormon


and
I
did
endeavor
to
preach
unto
this
people
but
my
mouthwas
shut
and
I
was
forbidden
that
I
should
preach
unto
them
forbehold
they
had
wilfully
rebelled
against
their
god
and
thebeloved
disciples
were
taken
away
out
of
the
land
because
oftheir
iniquitymormon


but
I
did
remain
among
them
but
I
was
forbidden
to
preachunto
them
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
becauseof
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
the
land
was
cursed
for
theirsakemormon


and
these
gadianton
robbers
who
were
among
the
lamanitesdid
infest
the
land
insomuch
that
the
inhabitants
thereof
beganto
hide
up
their
treasures
in
the
earth
and
they
becameslippery
because
the
lord
had
cursed
the
land
that
they
couldnot
hold
them
nor
retain
them
againmormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
sorceries
andwitchcrafts
and
magics
and
the
power
of
the
evil
one
waswrought
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
even
unto
the
fulfillingof
all
the
words
of
abinadi

also
samuel

lamanitemormon
chapter
mormon


and
it
came
to
pass
in
that
same
year
there
began
to
be
a
waragain
between
the
nephites
and
the
lamanites

andnotwithstanding
I
being
young
was
large
in
stature
thereforethe
people
of
nephi
appointed
me
that
I
should
be
their
leaderor
the
leader
of
their
armiesmormon


therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
in
my
sixteenth
year
I
did
goforth
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
the
nephites
against
thelamanites
therefore
three
hundred
and
twenty
and
six
years

and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
twenty

the
lamanites
did
come
upon

with
exceedinglygreat
power
insomuch
that
they
did
frighten
my
armies
thereforethey
would
not
fight
and
they
began
to
retreat
towards
the
northcountriesmormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
come
to
the
city
of
angolaand
we
did
take
possession
of
the
city
and
make
preparations
todefend
ourselves
against

lamanites

and
it
came
to
pass
thatwe
did
fortify
the
city
with
our
might
but
notwithstanding
allour
fortifications
the
lamanites
did
come
upon

and
did
driveus
out

and
they
did
also
drive
us
forth
out

and
we
marched
forth
and
came
to
the
land
of

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
gather

people
as
fastas
it
were
possible
that
we
might
get
them
together
in

bodymormon


but
behold
the

withlamanites
and
notwithstanding
the
great
destruction
which
hungover
my
people
they
did
not
repent
of
their
evil
doingstherefore
there
was
blood
and
carnage
spread
throughout
all
theface
of
the
land
both
on
the
part
of
the
nephites
and
also
onthe
part
of
the
lamanites
and
it
was
one
complete
revolutionthroughout
all
the
face
of
the
landmormon


and
now
the
lamanites
had
a
king
and
his
name
was
aaron
andhe
came
against
us
with
an
army
of
forty
and
four
thousand

andbehold
I
withstood
him
with
forty
and
two
thousand

and
it
cameto
pass
that
I
beat
him
with
my
army
that
he
fled
before
me

andbehold
all
this
was
done
and
three
hundred
and
thirty
years
hadpassed
awaymormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nephites
began
to
repent
oftheir
iniquity
and
began
to
cry
even
as
had
been
prophesied
bysamuel
the
prophet
for
behold
no
man
could
keep
that
which
washis
own
for
the
thieves
and
the
robbers
and
the
murderers
andthe
magic
art
and
the
witchcraft
which
was
in
the
landmormon


thus
there
began
to
be
a
mourning
and
a
lamentation
in
allthe
land
because
of
these
things
and
more
especially
among
thepeople
of
nephimormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
mormon
saw
theirlamentation
and
their
mourning
and
their
sorrow
before
the
lordmy
heart
did
begin
to
rejoice
within
me
knowing
the
mercies
andthe
longsuffering
of
the
lord
therefore
supposing
that
he
wouldbe
merciful
unto
them
that
they
would
again
become
a
righteouspeoplemormon


but
behold
this
my
joy
was
vain
for
their
sorrowing
was
notunto
repentance
because
of
the
goodness
of
god
but
it
wasrather
the
sorrowing
of
the
damned
because
the
lord
would
notalways
suffer
them
to
take
happiness
in
sinmormon


and
they
did
not
come
unto
jesus
with
broken
hearts
andcontrite
spirits
but
they
did
curse
god
and
wish
to
die
nevertheless
they
would
struggle
with
the
sword
for
their
livesmormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
my
sorrow
did
return
unto
me
againand
I
saw
that
the
day
of
grace
was
passed
with
them
bothtemporally
and
spiritually
for
I
saw
thousands
of
them
hewn
downin
open
rebellion
against
their
god
and
heaped
up
as
dung
uponthe
face
of
the
land

and
thus
three
hundred
and
forty
and
fouryears
had
passed
awaymormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
forty
andfifth
year
the
nephites
did
begin
to
flee
before
the
lamanitesand
they
were
pursued
until
they
came
even
to
the
land
of
jashonbefore
it
was
possible
to
stop
them
in
their
retreatmormon


and
now
the
city
of
jashon
was
near
the
land
where
ammaronhad
deposited
the
records
unto
the
lord
that
they
might
not
bedestroyed

and
behold
I
had
gone
according
to
the
word
ofammaron
and
taken
the
plates
of
nephi
and
did
make
a
recordaccording
to
the
words
of
ammaronmormon


and
upon
the
plates
of
nephi
I
did
make
a
full
account
of
allthe
wickedness
and
abominations
but
upon
these
plates
I
didforbear
to
make
a
full
account
of
their
wickedness
andabominations
for
behold
a
continual
scene
of
wickedness
andabominations

been
before

I
know
that
I
shall
be
lifted

and
it
came
to

that
in

the

were
hunted

driven

it
came
to

it

and
it
came

would
stand
boldly
beforethe

my

somewhat
to
vigor

thatthey
did
not
flee
from

lamanites

did
stand
withboldness
against

it
came
to

it
cameto

it
came
to

did
meet

again

did
beat

the
strength
of

was
not
with

wewere
left

that
the

therefore
we
had
become
weak
like

and
my
heart
did
sorrow
because
of
this
the
great
calamity
ofmy
people
because
of
their
wickedness

their
abominations
but
behold
we
did

behold
I
hademployed

and
it
came

after

making
in

unto

to
know
that
they
were
preparing

to

and
it
came
to

that
I
did
cause

together
at

acity
which

there
we
did

armies
that
we
might
stop
thearmies
of

lamanites
that
they
might
not
get
possession

therefore
we
did
fortify

with
allour
forcemormon


and
it
came
to

that
in

three
hundred
and

year

we
did
beat

didslay
a
great

their
dead
were
cast
into

and
now
because
of
this
great
thing
which
my
people
thenephites
had
done
they
began
to
boast
in
their
own
strengthand
began
to
swear
before

they
would
avengethemselves
of
the
blood
of
their

had
been
slain
bytheir

they
did
swear
by

also
by

they
would
go
up
to

cut

off

and
it
came

utterly
refuse

mormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
go
forth
among
the
nephitesand
did
repent
of
the
oath
which
I
had
made
that
I
would
no
moreassist
them
and
they
gave
me
command
again
of
their
armies
forthey
looked
upon
me
as
though
I
could
deliver
them
from
theirafflictionsmormon


but
behold
I
was
without
hope
for
I
knew
the
judgments
ofthe
lord
which
should
come
upon
them
for
they
repented
not
oftheir
iniquities
but
did
struggle
for
their
lives
withoutcalling
upon
that
being
who
created
themmormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lamanites
did
come
against
us
aswe
had
fled
to
the
city
of
jordan
but
behold
they
were
drivenback
that
they
did
not
take
the
city
at
that
timemormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
against
us
again
and
wedid
maintain
the
city

and
there
were
also
other
cities
whichwere
maintained
by
nephites
which
strongholds
did
cut
them
offthat
they
could
not
get
into
the
country
which
lay
before
us
todestroy
the
inhabitants
of
our
landmormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
whatsoever
lands
we
had
passed
byand
the
inhabitants
thereof
were
not
gathered
in
were
destroyedby
the
lamanites
and
their
towns
and
villages
and
cities
wereburned
with
fire
and
thus
three
hundred
and
seventy
and
nineyears
passed
awaymormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
eightiethyear
the
lamanites
did
come
again
against
us
to
battle
and
wedid
stand
against
them
boldly
but
it
was
all
in
vain
for
sogreat
were
their
numbers
that
they
did
tread
the
people
of
thenephites
under
their
feetmormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
again
take
to
flight
andthose
whose
flight
was
swifter
than
the
lamanites
did
escapeand
those
whose
flight
did
not
exceed
the
lamanites
were
sweptdown
and
destroyedmormon


and
now
behold
I
mormon
do
not
desire
to
harrow
up
thesouls
of
men
in
casting
before
them
such
an
awful
scene
of
bloodand
carnage
as
was
laid
before
mine
eyes
but
I
knowing
thatthese
things
must
surely
be
made
known
and
that
all
things
whichare
hid
must
be
revealed
upon
the
housetopsmormon


and
also
that
a
knowledge
of
these
things
must
come
unto
theremnant
of
these
people
and
also
unto
the
gentiles
who
the
lordhath
said
should
scatter
this
people
and
this
people
should
becounted
as
naught
among
themtherefore
I
write
a
smallabridgment
daring
not
to
give
a
full
account
of
the
things
whichI
have
seen
because
of
the
commandment
which
I
have
receivedand
also
that
ye
might
not
have
too
great
sorrow
because
of
thewickedness
of
this
peoplemormon


and
now
behold
this
I
speak
unto
their
seed
and
also
to
thegentiles
who
have
care
for
the
house
of
Israel
that
realize
andknow
from
whence
their
blessings
comemormon


for
I
know
that
such
will
sorrow
for
the
calamity
of
thehouse
of
Israel
yea
they
will
sorrow
for
the
destruction
ofthis
people
they
will
sorrow
that
this
people
had
not
repentedthat
they
might
have
been
clasped
in
the
arms
of
jesusmormon


now
these
things
are
written
unto
the
remnant
of
the
house
ofjacob
and
they
are
written
after
this
manner
because
it
isknown
of
god
that
wickedness
will
not
bring
them
forth
unto
themand
they
are
to
be
hid
up
unto
the
lord
that
they
may
come
forthin
his
own
due
timemormon


and
this
is
the
commandment
which
I
have
received
andbehold
they
shall
come
forth
according
to
the
commandment
of
thelord
when
he
shall
see
fit
in
his
wisdommormon


and
behold
they
shall
go
unto
the
unbelieving
of
the
jewsand
for
this
intent
shall
they
gothat
they
may
be
persuadedthat
jesus
is
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
that
thefather
may
bring
about
through
his
most
beloved
his
great
andeternal
purpose
in
restoring
the
jews
or
all
the
house
ofIsrael
to
the
land
of
their
inheritance
which
the
lord
theirgod
hath
given
them
unto
the
fulfilling
of
his
covenantmormon


and
also
that
the
seed
of
this
people
may
more
fully
believehis
gospel
which
shall
go
forth
unto
them
from
the
gentiles
forthis
people
shall
be
scattered
and
shall
become
a
dark
afilthy
and
a
loathsome
people
beyond
the
description
of
thatwhich
ever
hath
been
amongst
us
yea
even
that
which
hath
beenamong
the
lamanites
and
this
because
of
their
unbelief
andidolatrymormon


for
behold
the
spirit
of
the
lord
hath
already
ceased
tostrive
with
their
fathers
and
they
are
without
christ
and
god
inthe
world
and
they
are
driven
about
as
chaff
before
the
windmormon


they
were
once
a
delightsome
people
and
they
had
christ
fortheir
shepherd
yea
they
were
led
even
by
god
the
fathermormon


but
now
behold
they
are
led
about
by
satan
even
as
chaffis
driven
before
the
wind
or
as
a
vessel
is
tossed
about
uponthe
waves
without
sail
or
anchor
or
without
anything
wherewithto
steer
her
and
even
as
she
is
so
are
theymormon


and
behold
the
lord
hath
reserved
their
blessings
whichthey
might
have
received
in
the
land
for
the
gentiles
who
shallpossess
the
landmormon


but
behold
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
they
shall
be
drivenand
scattered
by
the
gentiles
and
after
they
have
been
drivenand
scattered
by
the
gentiles
behold
then
will
the
lordremember
the
covenant
which
he
made
unto
abraham
and
unto
all
thehouse
of
Israelmormon


and
also
the
lord
will
remember
the
prayers
of
the
righteouswhich
have
been
put
up
unto
him
for
themmormon


and
then
o
ye
gentiles
how
can
ye
stand
before
the
power
ofgod
except
ye
shall
repent
and
turn
from
your
evil
waysmormon


know
ye
not
that
ye
are
in

hands
of

know
ye
notthat
he
hath
all
power
and
at
his
great
command
the
earth
shallbe
rolled

therefore
repent

and

chapter
mormon


and
now
I
finish
my
record
concerning
the
destruction
of
mypeople
the
nephites

and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
marchforth
before
the
lamanitesmormon


and
I
mormon
wrote
an
epistle
unto
the
king
of
thelamanites
and
desired
of
him
that
he
would
grant
unto
us
that
wemight
gather
together
our
people
unto
the
land
of
cumorah
by
ahill
which
was
called
cumorah
and
there
we
could
give
thembattlemormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
of
the
lamanites
did
grantunto
me
the
thing
which
I
desiredmormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
march
forth
to
the
land
ofcumorah
and
we
did
pitch
our
tents
around
about
the
hillcumorah
and
it
was
in
a
land
of
many
waters
rivers
andfountains
and
here
we
had
hope
to
gain
advantage
over
thelamanitesmormon


and
when
three
hundred
and
eighty
and
four
years
had
passedaway
we
had
gathered
in
all
the
remainder
of
our
people
unto
theland
of
cumorahmormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
we
had
gathered
in
all
ourpeople
in
one
to
the
land
of
cumorah
behold
I
mormon
began
tobe
old
and
knowing
it
to
be
the
last
struggle
of
my
people
andhaving
been
commanded
of
the
lord
that
I
should
not
suffer
therecords
which
had
been
handed
down
by
our
fathers
which
weresacred
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
lamanites
for
thelamanites
would
destroy
them
therefore
I
made
this
record
out
ofthe
plates
of
nephi
and
hid
up
in
the
hill
cumorah
all
therecords
which
had
been
entrusted
to
me
by
the
hand
of
the
lordsave
it
were
these
few
plates
which
I
gave
unto
my
son
moronimormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
my
people
with
their
wives
and
theirchildren
did
now
behold
the
armies
of
the
lamanites
marchingtowards
them
and
with
that
awful
fear
of
death
which
fills
thebreasts
of
all
the
wicked
did
they
await
to
receive
themmormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
to
battle
against
us
andevery
soul
was
filled
with
terror
because
of
the
greatness
oftheir
numbersmormon


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
fall
upon
my
people
with
thesword
and
with
the
bow
and
with
the
arrow
and
with
the
ax
andwith
all
manner
of
weapons

and
it
came
to
pass
that
my
men
were
hewn
down

even
myten
thousand

were
with

and
I
fell
wounded
in

that

behold
I

unto

that
ye
would
be
more
miserable
todwell

a
holy

than
ye

for
behold

the

the

fire

o
then
ye

turn

that
perhaps
ye

spotless
pure
fair
and
white
having
been
cleansed
bythe
blood
of
the

at
that
great
and
last
daymormon


and
again
I
speak
unto
you
who
deny
the
revelations
of
godand
say
that
they
are
done
away
that
there
are
no
revelationsnor
prophecies
nor
gifts
nor
healing
nor
speaking
withtongues
and
the
interpretation
of
tonguesmormon


behold
I
say
unto
you
he
that
denieth
these
things
knowethnot
the
gospel
of
christ
yea
he
has
not
read
the
scriptures
ifso
he
does
not
understand
themmormon


for
do
we
not
read
that
god
is
the
same
yesterday
today
andforever
and
in
him
there
is
no
variableness
neither
shadow
ofchangingmormon


and
now
if
ye
have
imagined
up
unto
yourselves
a
god
who
dothvary
and
in
whom
there
is
shadow
of
changing
then
have
yeimagined
up
unto
yourselves
a
god
who
is
not
god
of
miraclesmormon


but
behold
I
will
show
unto
you
a
god
of
miracles
even
thegod
of
abraham
and
the
god
of
Isaac
and
the
god
of
jacob
andit
is
that
same
god
who
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
andall
things
that
in
them
aremormon


behold
he
created
adam
and
by
adam
came
the
fall
of
man
and
because
of
the
fall
of
man
came
jesus
christ
even
the
fatherand
the
son
and
because
of
jesus
christ
came
the
redemption
ofmanmormon


and
because
of
the
redemption
of
man
which
came
by
jesuschrist
they
are
brought
back
into
the
presence
of
the
lord
yeathis
is
wherein
all
men
are
redeemed
because
the
death
of
christbringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
which
bringeth
to
pass
aredemption
from
an
endless
sleep
from
which
sleep
all
men
shallbe
awakened
by
the
power
of
god
when
the
trump
shall
sound
andthey
shall
come
forth
both
small
and
great
and
all
shall
standbefore
his
bar
being
redeemed
and
loosed
from
this
eternal
bandof
death
which
death
is
a
temporal
deathmormon


and
then
cometh
the
judgment
of
the
holy
one
upon
them
andthen
cometh
the
time
that
he
that
is
filthy
shall
be
filthystill
and
he
that
is
righteous
shall
be
righteous
still
he
thatis
happy
shall
be
happy
still
and
he
that
is
unhappy
shall
beunhappy
stillmormon


and
now
o
all
ye
that
have
imagined
up
unto
yourselves
a
godwho
can
do
no
miracles
I
would
ask
of
you
have
all
these
thingspassed
of
which
I
have
spoken

has
the
end
come
yet

behold
Isay
unto
you
nay
and
god
has
not
ceased
to
be
a
god
ofmiraclesmormon


behold
are
not
the
things
that
god
hath
wrought
marvelous
inour
eyes

yea
and
who
can
comprehend
the
marvelous
works
ofgodmormon


who
shall
say
that
it
was
not
a
miracle
that
by
his
word
theheaven
and
the
earth
should
be
and
by
the
power
of
his
word
manwas
created
of
the
dust
of
the
earth
and
by
the
power
of
hisword
have
miracles
been
wroughtmormon


and
who
shall
say
that
jesus
christ
did
not
many
mightymiracles

and
there
were
many
mighty
miracles
wrought
by
thehands
of
the
apostlesmormon


and
if
there
were
miracles
wrought
then
why
has
god
ceasedto
be
a
god
of
miracles
and
yet
be
an
unchangeable
being

andbehold
I
say
unto
you
he
changeth
not
if
so
he
would
cease
tobe
god
and
he
ceaseth
not
to
be
god
and
is
a
god
of
miraclesmormon


and
the
reason
why
he
ceaseth
to
do
miracles
among
thechildren
of
men
is
because
that
they
dwindle
in
unbelief
anddepart
from
the
right
way
and
know
not
the
god
in
whom
theyshould
trustmormon


behold
I
say
unto
you
that
whoso
believeth
in
christdoubting
nothing
whatsoever
he
shall
ask
the
father
in
the
nameof
christ
it
shall
be
granted
him
and
this
promise
is
unto
alleven
unto
the
ends
of
the
earthmormon


for
behold
thus
said
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
unto
hisdisciples
who
should
tarry
yea
and
also
to
all
his
disciplesin
the
hearing
of
the
multitude
go
ye
into
all
the
world
andpreach
the
gospel
to
every
creaturemormon


and
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be
saved
but
hethat
believeth
not
shall
be
damnedmormon


and
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that

my
nameshall
they
cast
out
devils
they
shall
speak
with
new
tonguesthey
shall
take
up
serpents
and
if
they
drink
any
deadly
thingit
shall
not
hurt
them
they
shall
lay

on
the
sick
and
theyshall
recovermormon


and
whosoever
shall
believe
in
my
name
doubting
nothingunto
him
will
I
confirm
all
my
words
even
unto
the
ends
of
theearthmormon


and
now
behold
who
can
stand
against
the
works
of
the
lordwho
can
deny
his
sayings

who
will
rise
up
against
the
almightypower
of
the

o
then

ask
the

soever
ye

and
thus
I
will
do
untothee
because
this
long
time
ye
have
cried
unto

chapter
ether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
jared
and
his
brother
and
theirfamilies
and
also
the
friends
of
jared
and
his
brother
and
theirfamilies
went
down
into
the
valley
which
was
northward
and
thename
of
the
valley
was
nimrod
being
called
after
the
mightyhunter
with
their
flocks
which
they
had
gathered
together
maleand
female
of
every
kindether


and
they
did
also
lay
snares
and
catch
fowls
of
the
air
andthey
did
also
prepare
a
vessel
in
which
they
did
carry
with
themthe
fish
of
the
watersether


and
they
did
also
carry
with
them
deseret
which
byinterpretation
is
a
honey
bee
and
thus
they
did
carry
with
themswarms
of
bees
and
all
manner
of
that
which
was
upon
the
face
ofthe
land
seeds
of
every
kindether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
come
down
into
thevalley
of
nimrod
the
lord
came
down
and
talked
with
the
brotherof
jared
and
he
was
in
a
cloud
and
the
brother
of
jared
saw
himnotether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
commanded
them
that
theyshould
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
yea
into
that
quarter
wherethere
never
had
man
been

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
didgo
before
them
and
did
talk
with
them
as
he
stood
in
a
cloudand
gave
directions
whither
they
should
travelether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
travel
in
the
wildernessand
did
build
barges
in
which
they
did
cross
many
waters
beingdirected
continually
by
the
hand
of
the
lordether


and
the
lord
would
not
suffer
that
they
should
stop
beyond
thesea
in
the
wilderness
but
he
would
that
they
should
come
fortheven
unto
the
land
of
promise
which
was
choice
above
all
otherlands
which
the
lord
god
had
preserved
for
a
righteous
peopleether


and
he
had
sworn
in
his
wrath
unto
the
brother
of
jared
thatwhoso
should
possess
this
land
of
promise
from
that
timehenceforth
and
forever
should
serve
him
the
true
and
only
godor
they
should
be
swept
off
when
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
shouldcome
upon
themether


and
now
we
can
behold
the
decrees
of
god
concerning
thisland
that
it
is
a
land
of
promise
and
whatsoever
nation
shallpossess
it
shall
serve
god
or
they
shall
be
swept
off
when
thefulness
of
his
wrath
shall
come
upon
them

and
the
fulness
ofhis
wrath
cometh
upon
them
when
they
are
ripened
in
iniquityether


for
behold
this
is
a
land
which
is
choice
above
all
otherlands
wherefore
he
that
doth
possess
it
shall
serve
god
or
shallbe
swept
off
for
it
is
the
everlasting
decree
of
god

and
it
isnot
until
the
fulness
of
iniquity
among
the
children
of
the
landthat
they
are
swept
offether


and
this
cometh
unto
you
o
ye
gentiles
that
ye
may
know
thedecrees
of
godthat
ye
may
repent
and
not
continue
in
youriniquities
until
the
fulness
come
that
ye
may
not
bring
down
thefulness
of
the
wrath
of
god
upon
you
as
the
inhabitants
of
theland
have
hitherto
doneether


behold
this
is
a
choice
land
and
whatsoever
nation
shallpossess
it
shall
be
free
from
bondage
and
from
captivity
andfrom
all
other
nations
under
heaven
if
they
will
but
serve
thegod
of
the
land
who
is
jesus
christ
who
hath
been
manifested
bythe
things
which
we
have
writtenether


and
now
I
proceed
with
my
record
for
behold
it
came
to
passthat
the
lord
did
bring
jared
and
his
brethren
forth
even
to
thatgreat
sea
which
divideth
the
lands

and
as
they
came
to
the
seathey
pitched
their
tents
and
they
called
the
name
of
the
placemoriancumer
and
they
dwelt
in
tents
and
dwelt
in
tents
upon
theseashore
for
the
space
of
four
yearsether


and
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
four
years
that
the
lordcame
again
unto
the
brother
of
jared
and
stood
in
a
cloud
andtalked
with
him

and
for
the
space
of
three
hours
did
the
lordtalk
with
the
brother
of
jared
and
chastened
him
because
heremembered
not
to
call
upon
the
name
of
the
lordether


and
the
brother
of
jared
repented
of
the
evil
which
he
haddone
and
did
call
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
for
his
brethren
whowere
with
him

and
the
lord
said
unto
him
I
will
forgive
theeand
thy
brethren
of
their
sins
but
thou
shalt
not
sin
any
morefor
ye
shall
remember
that
my
spirit
will
not
always
strive
withman
wherefore
if
ye
will
sin
until
ye
are
fully
ripe
ye
shallbe
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
lord

and
these
are
mythoughts
upon
the
land
which
I
shall
give
you
for
yourinheritance
for
it
shall
be
a
land
choice
above
all
other
landsether


and
the
lord
said
go
to
work
and
build
after
the
manner
ofbarges
which
ye
have
hitherto
built

and
it
came
to
pass
thatthe
brother
of
jared
did
go
to
work
and
also
his
brethren
andbuilt
barges
after
the
manner
which
they
had
built
according
tothe
instructions
of
the
lord

and
they
were
small
and
they
werelight
upon
the
water
even
like
unto
the
lightness
of
a
fowl
uponthe
waterether


and
they
were
built
after
a
manner
that
they
were
exceedinglytight
even
that
they
would
hold
water
like
unto
a
dish
and
thebottom
thereof
was
tight
like
unto
a
dish
and
the
sides
thereofwere
tight
like
unto
a
dish
and
the
ends
thereof
were
peakedand
the
top
thereof
was
tight
like
unto
a
dish
and
the
lengththereof
was
the
length
of
a
tree
and
the
door
thereof
when
itwas
shut
was
tight
like
unto
a
dishether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
jared
cried
unto
thelord
saying
o
lord
I
have
performed
the
work
which
thou
hastcommanded
me
and
I
have
made
the
barges
according
as
thou
hastdirected
meether


and
behold
o
lord
in
them
there
is
no
light
whither
shallwe
steer

and
also
we
shall
perish
for
in
them
we
cannotbreathe
save
it
is
the
air
which
is
in
them
therefore
we
shallperishether


and
the
lord
said
unto
the
brother
of
jared
behold
thoushalt
make
a
hole
in
the
top
and
also
in
the
bottom
and
whenthou
shalt
suffer
for
air
thou
shalt
unstop
the
hole
and
receiveair

and
if
it
be
so
that
the
water
come
in
upon
thee
beholdye
shall
stop
the
hole
that
ye
may
not
perish
in
the
floodether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
jared
did
soaccording
as
the
lord
had
commandedether


and
he
cried
again
unto
the
lord
saying
o
lord
behold
Ihave
done
even
as
thou
hast
commanded
me
and
I
have
prepared
thevessels
for
my
people
and
behold
there
is
no
light
in
them
behold
o
lord
wilt
thou
suffer
that
we
shall
cross
this
greatwater
in
darknessether


and
the
lord
said
unto
the
brother
of
jared
what
will
yethat
I
should
do
that
ye
may
have
light
in
your
vessels

forbehold
ye
cannot
have
windows
for
they
will
be
dashed
inpieces
neither
shall
ye
take
fire
with
you
for
ye
shall
not
goby
the
light
of
fireether


for
behold
ye
shall
be
as
a
whale
in
the
midst
of
the
seafor
the
mountain
waves
shall
dash
upon
you

nevertheless
I
willbring
you
up
again
out
of
the
depths
of
the
sea
for
the
windshave
gone
forth
out
of
my
mouth
and
also
the
rains
and
thefloods
have
I
sent
forthether


and
behold
I
prepare
you
against
these
things
for
ye
cannotcross
this
great
deep
save
I
prepare
you
against
the
waves
of
thesea
and
the
winds
which
have
gone
forth
and
the
floods
whichshall
come

therefore
what
will
ye
that
I
should
prepare
for
youthat
ye
may
have
light
when
ye
are
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
ofthe
seaether
chapter
ether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
jared
now
the
numberof
the
vessels
which
had
been
prepared
was
eight
went
forth
untothe
mount
which
they
called
the
mount
shelem
because
of
itsexceeding
height
and
did
molten
out
of
a
rock
sixteen
smallstones
and
they
were
white
and
clear
even
as
transparent
glassand
he
did
carry
them
in
his
hands
upon
the
top
of
the
mount
andcried
again
unto
the
lord
sayingether


o
lord
thou
hast
said
that
we
must
be
encompassed
about
bythe
floods

now
behold
o
lord
and
do
not
be
angry
with
thyservant
because
of
his
weakness
before
thee
for
we
know
thatthou
art
holy
and
dwellest
in

heavens
and
that
we
areunworthy
before

because
of
the
fall

desiresether


behold

smitten
us
because
of
our
iniquityand

forth
and
for
these
many
years

wilderness
nevertheless
thou
hast
been
merciful
unto
uso
lord
look
upon
me
in
pity
and
turn
away
thine
anger
from
thisthy

and
I

canst
do
this

we
know
that
thou
artable
to
show
forth
great
power
which
looks
small
unto
theunderstanding
of
menether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
brother
of
jared
had
saidthese
words
behold
the
lord
stretched
forth
his
hand
andtouched
the
stones
one
by
one
with
his
finger

and
the
veil
wastaken
from
off
the
eyes
of
the
brother
of
jared
and
he
saw
thefinger
of
the
lord
and
it
was
as
the
finger
of
a
man
like
untoflesh
and
blood
and
the
brother
of
jared
fell
down
before
thelord
for
he
was
struck
with
fearether


and
the
lord
saw
that
the
brother
of
jared
had
fallen
to
theearth
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
arise
why
hast
thou
fallenether


and
he
saith
unto
the
lord
I
saw
the
finger
of
the
lord
andI
feared
lest
he
should
smite
me
for
I
knew
not
that
the
lordhad
flesh
and
bloodether


and
the
lord
said
unto
him
because
of
thy
faith
thou
hastseen
that
I
shall
take
upon
me
flesh
and
blood
and
never
has
mancome
before
me
with
such
exceeding
faith
as
thou
hast
for
wereit
not
so
ye
could
not
have
seen
my
finger

sawest
thou
morethan
thisether


and
he
answered
nay
lord
show
thyself
unto
meether


and
the
lord
said
unto
him
believest
thou
the
words
which
Ishall
speakether


and
he
answered
yea
lord
I
know
that
thou
speakest
thetruth
for
thou
art
a
god
of
truth
and
canst
not
lieether


and
when
he
had
said
these
words
behold
the
lord
showedhimself
unto
him
and
said
because
thou
knowest
these
things
yeare
redeemed
from
the
fall
therefore
ye
are
brought
back
into
mypresence
therefore
I
show
myself
unto
youether


behold
I
am
he
who
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
theworld
to
redeem
my
people

behold
I
am
jesus
christ

I
am
thefather
and
the
son

In
me
shall
all
mankind
have
life
and
thateternally
even
they
who
shall
believe
on
my
name
and
they
shallbecome
my
sons
and
my
daughtersether


and
never
have
I
showed
myself
unto
man
whom
I
have
createdfor
never
has
man
believed
in
me
as
thou
hast

seest
thou
thatye
are
created
after
mine
own
image

yea
even
all
men
werecreated
in
the
beginning
after
mine
own
imageether


behold
this
body
which
ye
now
behold
is
the
body
of
myspirit
and
man
have
I
created
after
the
body
of
my
spirit
andeven
as
I
appear
unto
thee
to
be
in
the
spirit
will
I
appear
untomy
people
in
the
fleshether


and
now
as
I
moroni
said
I
could
not
make
a
full
accountof
these
things
which
are
written
therefore
it
sufficeth
me
tosay
that
jesus
showed
himself
unto
this
man
in
the
spirit
evenafter
the
manner
and
in
the
likeness
of
the
same
body
even
as
heshowed
himself
unto
the
nephitesether


and
he
ministered
unto
him
even
as
he
ministered
unto
thenephites
and
all
this
that
this
man
might
know
that
he
was
godbecause
of
the
many
great
works
which
the
lord
had
showed
untohimether


and
because
of
the
knowledge
of
this
man
he
could
not
be
keptfrom
beholding
within
the
veil
and
he
saw
the
finger
of
jesuswhich
when
he
saw
he
fell
with
fear
for
he
knew
that
it
wasthe
finger
of
the
lord
and
he
had
faith
no
longer
for
he
knewnothing
doubtingether


wherefore
having
this
perfect
knowledge
of
god
he
could
notbe
kept
from
within
the
veil
therefore
he
saw
jesus
and
he
didminister
unto
himether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
said
unto
the
brother
ofjared
behold
thou
shalt
not
suffer
these
things
which
ye
haveseen
and
heard
to
go
forth
unto
the
world
until
the
time
comeththat
I
shall
glorify
my
name
in
the
flesh
wherefore
ye
shalltreasure
up
the
things
which
ye
have
seen
and
heard
and
show
itto
no
manether


and
behold
when
ye
shall
come
unto
me
ye
shall
write
themand
shall
seal
them
up
that
no
one
can
interpret
them
for
yeshall
write
them
in
a
language
that
they
cannot
be
readether


and
behold
these
two
stones
will
I
give
unto
thee
and
yeshall
seal
them
up
also
with
the
things
which
ye
shall
writeether


for
behold
the
language
which
ye
shall
write
I
haveconfounded
wherefore
I
will
cause
in
my
own
due
time
that
thesestones
shall
magnify
to
the
eyes
of
men
these
things
which
yeshall
writeether


and
when
the
lord
had
said
these
words
he
showed
unto
thebrother
of
jared
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
which
had
beenand
also
all
that
would
be
and
he
withheld
them
not
from
hissight
even
unto
the
ends
of
the
earthether


for
he
had
said
unto
him
in
times
before
that
if
he
wouldbelieve
in
him
that
he
could
show
unto
him
all
thingsit
shouldbe
shown
unto
him
therefore
the
lord
could
not
withhold
anythingfrom
him
for
he
knew
that
the
lord
could
show
him
all
thingsether


and
the
lord
said
unto
him
write
these
things
and
seal
themup
and
I
will
show
them
in
mine
own
due
time
unto
the
childrenof
menether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
commanded
him
that
heshould
seal
up
the
two
stones
which
he
had
received
and
showthem
not
until
the
lord
should
show
them
unto
the
children
ofmenether
chapter
ether


and
the
lord
commanded
the
brother
of
jared
to
go
down
out
ofthe
mount
from
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
write
the
thingswhich
he
had
seen
and
they
were
forbidden
to
come
unto
thechildren
of
men
until
after
that
he
should
be
lifted
up
upon
thecross
and
for
this
cause
did
king
mosiah
keep
them
that
theyshould
not
come
unto
the
world
until
after
christ
should
showhimself
unto
his
peopleether


and
after
christ
truly
had
showed
himself
unto
his
people
hecommanded
that
they
should
be
made
manifestether


and
now
after
that
they
have
all
dwindled
in
unbelief
andthere
is
none
save
it
be
the
lamanites
and
they
have
rejectedthe
gospel
of
christ
therefore
I
am
commanded
that
I
should
hidethem
up
again
in
the
earthether


behold
I
have
written
upon
these
plates
the
very
things
whichthe
brother
of
jared
saw
and
there
never
were
greater
thingsmade
manifest
than
those
which
were
made
manifest
unto
thebrother
of
jaredether


wherefore
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
to
write
them
and
I
havewritten
them

and
he
commanded
me
that
I
should
seal
them
upand
he
also
hath
commanded
that
I
should
seal
up
theinterpretation
thereof
wherefore
I
have
sealed
up
theinterpreters
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
lordether


for
the
lord
said
unto
me
they
shall
not
go
forth
unto
thegentiles
until
the
day
that
they
shall
repent
of
their
iniquityand
become
clean
before
the
lordether


and
in
that
day
that
they
shall
exercise
faith
in
me
saiththe
lord
even
as
the
brother
of
jared
did
that
they
may
becomesanctified
in
me
then
will
I
manifest
unto
them
the
things
whichthe

he
that

amenether
chapter
ether


and
now
I
moroni
proceed
to
give
the
record
of
jared
and
hisbrotherether


for
it
came
to
pass
after
the
lord
had
prepared
the
stoneswhich
the
brother
of
jared
had
carried
up
into
the
mount
thebrother
of
jared
came
down
out
of
the
mount
and
he
did
put
forththe
stones
into
the
vessels
which
were
prepared
one
in
each
endthereof
and
behold
they
did
give
light
unto
the
vesselsether


and
thus
the
lord
caused
stones
to
shine
in
darkness
to
givelight
unto
men
women
and
children
that
they
might
not
crossthe
great
waters
in
darknessether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
prepared
all
manner
offood
that
thereby
they
might
subsist
upon
the
water
and
alsofood
for
their
flocks
and
herds
and
whatsoever
beast
or
animalor
fowl
that
they
should
carry
with
themand
it
came
to
passthat
when
they
had
done
all
these
things
they
got
aboard
of
theirvessels
or
barges
and
set
forth
into
the
sea
commendingthemselves
unto
the
lord
their
godether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
god
caused
that
there
shouldbe
a
furious
wind
blow
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
towards
thepromised
land
and
thus
they
were
tossed
upon
the
waves
of
thesea
before
the
windether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
many
times
buried
in
thedepths
of
the
sea
because
of
the
mountain
waves
which
broke
uponthem
and
also
the
great
and
terrible
tempests
which
were
causedby
the
fierceness
of
the
windether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
were
buried
in
the
deepthere
was
no
water
that
could
hurt
them
their
vessels
beingtight
like
unto
a
dish
and
also
they
were
tight
like
unto
theark
of
noah
therefore
when
they
were
encompassed
about
by
manywaters
they
did
cry
unto
the
lord
and
he
did
bring
them
forthagain
upon
the
top
of
the
watersether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
wind
did
never
cease
to
blowtowards
the
promised
land
while
they
were
upon
the
waters
andthus
they
were
driven
forth
before
the
windether


and
they
did
sing
praises
unto
the
lord
yea
the
brother
ofjared
did
sing
praises
unto
the
lord
and
he
did
thank
and
praisethe
lord
all
the
day
long
and
when
the
night
came
they
did
notcease
to
praise
the
lordether


and
thus
they
were
driven
forth
and
no
monster
of
the
seacould
break
them
neither
whale
that
could
mar
them
and
they
didhave
light
continually
whether
it
was
above
the
water
or
underthe
waterether


and
thus
they
were
driven
forth
three
hundred
and
forty
andfour
days
upon
the
waterether


and
they
did
land
upon
the
shore
of
the
promised
land

andwhen
they
had
set
their
feet
upon
the
shores
of
the
promised
landthey
bowed
themselves
down
upon
the
face
of
the
land
and
didhumble
themselves
before
the
lord
and
did
shed
tears
of
joybefore
the
lord
because
of
the
multitude
of
his
tender
merciesover
themether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
forth
upon
the
face
of
theland
and
began
to
till
the
earthether


and
jared
had
four
sons
and
they
were
called
jacom
andgilgah
and
mahah
and
orihahether


and
the
brother
of
jared
also
begat
sons
and

and
the
friends
of
jared
and
his
brother
were
in
number
abouttwenty
and
two
souls
and
they
also
begat
sons
and
daughtersbefore
they
came
to
the
promised
land
and
therefore
they
beganto
be
manyether


and
they
were
taught
to
walk
humbly
before
the
lord
and
theywere
also
taught
from
on
highether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
spread
upon
the
faceof
the
land
and
to
multiply
and
to
till
the
earth
and
they
didwax
strong
in
the
landether


and
the
brother
of
jared
began
to
be
old
and
saw
that
hemust
soon

down
to
the
grave
wherefore
he
said
unto
jared
letus

together

may
number
them

wemay
know
of
them
what
they

now
the
land
of

was
near

that

andshule
waxed
strong
and
became
mighty
as
to
the
strength
of

and
he
was
also
mighty

wherefore
he
came
to
the
hill

and
he
did
molten
outof
the
hill
and
made
swords
out
of
steel
for

by
which
means
he
obtained

and
now
because
of
the
thing
which
shule
had
done
his
fatherbestowed
upon
him
the
kingdom
therefore
he
began
to
reign
in

and
it
came
to

that
he
did
execute

inrighteousness
and
he
did
spread

the
face
ofthe

and
it
came
to

and
corihor
repented
of
the
many
evils
which
he
had
donewherefore
shule
gave
him
power
in
his
kingdomether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
corihor
had
many
sons
and
daughtersand
among
the
sons
of
corihor
there
was
one
whose
name
was
noahether


and
it
came
to

that
noah
rebelled
against
shule
theking
and
also
his
father
corihor
and
drew
away
cohor
hisbrother
and
also
all
his
brethren
and
many
of
the
peopleether


and
he
gave
battle
unto
shule
the
king
in
which
he
didobtain
the
land
of
their
first
inheritance
and
he
became
a
kingover
that
part
of
the
landether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
gave
battle
again
unto
shule
theking
and
he
took
shule
the
king
and
carried
him
away
captiveinto

and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
about
to
put
him
to
death
thesons
of
shule
crept
into
the
house
of
noah
by
night
and
slew
himand
broke
down
the
door
of
the
prison
and
brought
out
theirfather
and
placed
him
upon
his
throne
in
his
own
kingdomether


wherefore
the
son
of
noah
did
build
up
his
kingdom
in
hisstead
nevertheless
they
did
not
gain
power
any
more
over
shulethe
king
and
the
people
who
were
under
the
reign
of
shule
theking
did
prosper
exceedingly
and
wax
greatether


and
the
country
was
divided
and
there
were
two
kingdoms
thekingdom
of
shule
and
the
kingdom
of
cohor
the
son
of
noahether


and
cohor
the
son
of
noah
caused
that
his
people
shouldgive
battle
unto
shule
in
which
shule
did
beat
them
and
did
slaycohorether


and
now
cohor
had
a
son
who
was
called
nimrod
and
nimrodgave
up
the
kingdom
of
cohor
unto
shule
and
he
did
gain
favor
inthe
eyes
of
shule
wherefore
shule
did
bestow
great
favors
uponhim
and
he
did
do
in
the
kingdom
of
shule
according
to
hisdesiresether


and
also
in
the
reign
of
shule
there
came
prophets
among
thepeople
who
were
sent
from
the
lord
prophesying
that
thewickedness
and
idolatry
of
the
people
was
bringing
a
curse
uponthe
land
and
they
should
be
destroyed
if
they
did
not
repentether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
did
revile
against
theprophets
and
did
mock
them

and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
shuledid
execute
judgment
against
all
those
who
did
revile
against
theprophetsether


and
he
did
execute
a
law
throughout
all
the
land
which
gavepower
unto
the
prophets
that
they
should
go
whithersoever
theywould
and
by
this
cause
the
people
were
brought
unto
repentanceether


and
because
the
people
did
repent
of
their
iniquities
andidolatries
the
lord
did
spare
them
and
they
began
to
prosperagain
in
the
land

and
it
came
to
pass
that
shule
begat
sons
anddaughters
in
his
old
ageether


and
there
were
no
more
wars
in
the
days
of
shule
and
heremembered
the
great
things
that
the
lord
had
done
for
hisfathers
in
bringing
them
across
the
great
deep
into
the
promisedland
wherefore
he
did
execute
judgment
in
righteousness

and
it
came
to

that
he
begat
omer
and
omer
reigned
inhis

and
omer
begat
jared
and
jared
begat
sons
anddaughtersether


and
jared
rebelled
against
his
father
and
came
and
dwelt
inthe
land
of
heth

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
flatter
manypeople
because
of
his
cunning
words
until
he
had
gained
thehalf
of
the
kingdomether


and
when
he
had
gained
the
half
of
the
kingdom
he
gave
battleunto
his
father
and
he
did
carry
away
his
father
into
captivityand
did
make
him
serve
in
captivityether


and
now
in
the
days
of
the
reigns
of
omer
he
was
in
captivitythe
half
of
his
days

and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
begat
sons
anddaughters
among
whom
were
esrom
and
coriantumrether


and
they
were
exceedingly
angry
because
of
the
doings
of
jaredtheir
brother
insomuch
that
they
did
raise
an
army
and
gavebattle
unto
jared

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
give
battleunto
him
by
nightether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
slain
the
army
of
jaredthey
were
about
to
slay
him
also
and
he
plead
with
them
thatthey
would
not
slay
him
and
he
would
give
up
the
kingdom
untohis
father

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
grant
unto
him
hislifeether


and
now
jared
became
exceedingly
sorrowful
because
of
the
lossof
the
kingdom
for
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
the
kingdom
andupon
the
glory
of
the
worldether


now
the
daughter
of
jared
being
exceedingly
expert
and
seeingthe
sorrows
of
her
father
thought
to
devise
a
plan
whereby
shecould
redeem
the
kingdom
unto
her
fatherether


now
the
daughter
of
jared
was
exceedingly
fair

and
it
cameto
pass
that
she
did
talk
with
her
father
and
said
unto
himwhereby
hath
my
father
so
much
sorrow

hath
he
not
read
therecord
which
our
fathers
brought
across
the
great
deep

beholdis
there
not
an
account
concerning
them
of
old
that
they
bytheir
secret
plans
did
obtain
kingdoms
and
great
gloryether


and
now
therefore
let
my
father
send
for
akish
the
son
ofkimnor
and
behold
I
am
fair
and
I
will
dance
before
him
and
Iwill
please
him
that
he
will
desire
me
to
wife
wherefore
if
heshall
desire
of
thee
that
ye
shall
give
unto
him
me
to

thenshall
ye
say
I
will
give
her
if
ye
will
bring
unto
me
the
headof
my
father
the
kingether


and
now
omer
was
a
friend
to
akish
wherefore
when
jared
hadsent
for
akish
the
daughter
of
jared
danced
before
him
that
shepleased
him
insomuch
that
he
desired
her
to
wife

and
it
cameto
pass
that
he
said
unto
jared
give
her
unto
me
to
wifeether


and
jared
said
unto
him
I
will
give
her
unto
you
if
ye
willbring
unto
me
the
head
of
my
father
the
kingether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
akish
gathered
in
unto
the
house
ofjared
all
his
kinsfolk
and
said
unto
them
will
ye
swear
unto
methat
ye
will
be
faithful
unto
me
in
the
thing
which
I
shalldesire
of
youether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
all
sware
unto
him
by
the
godof
heaven
and
also
by
the
heavens
and
also
by
the
earth
and
bytheir
heads
that
whoso
should
vary
from
the
assistance
whichakish
desired
should
lose
his
head
and
whoso
should
divulgewhatsoever
thing
akish
made
known
unto
them
the
same
should
losehis
lifeether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
they
did
agree
with
akish

andakish
did
administer
unto
them
the
oaths
which
were
given
by
themof
old
who
also
sought
power
which
had
been
handed
down
evenfrom
cain
who
was
a
murderer
from
the
beginningether


and
they
were
kept
up
by
the
power
of
the
devil
to
administerthese
oaths
unto
the
people
to
keep
them
in
darkness
to
helpsuch
as
sought
power
to
gain
power
and
to
murder
and
toplunder
and
to
lie
and
to
commit
all
manner
of
wickedness
andwhoredomsether


and
it
was
the
daughter
of
jared
who
put
it
into
his
heart
tosearch
up
these
things
of
old
and
jared
put
it
into
the
heart
ofakish
wherefore
akish
administered
it
unto
his
kindred
andfriends
leading
them
away
by
fair
promises
to
do
whatsoeverthing
he
desiredether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
formed
a
secret
combinationeven
as
they
of
old
which
combination
is
most
abominable
andwicked
above
all
in
the
sight
of
godether


for
the
lord
worketh
not
in
secret
combinations
neither
dothhe
will
that
man
should
shed
blood
but
in
all
things
hathforbidden
it
from
the
beginning
of
manether


and
now
I
moroni
do
not
write
the
manner
of
their
oaths
andcombinations
for
it
hath
been
made
known
unto
me
that
they
arehad
among
all
people
and
they
are
had
among
the
lamanitesether


and
they
have
caused
the
destruction
of
this
people
of
whom
Iam
now
speaking
and
also
the
destruction
of
the
people
of
nephiether


and
whatsoever
nation
shall
uphold
such
secret
combinationsto
get
power
and
gain
until
they
shall
spread
over

they
shall
be
destroyed
for
the
lord
will
not
sufferthat
the
blood
of
his
saints
which
shall
be
shed
by
them
shallalways
cry
unto
him
from
the
ground
for
vengeance
upon
them
andyet
he

wherefore
o
ye
gentiles
it
is
wisdom
in
god
that
thesethings
should
be
shown
unto
you
that
thereby
ye
may
repent
ofyour
sins
and
suffer
not
that
these
murderous
combinations

wherefore
the
lord
commandeth
you
when
ye
shall
see
thesethings
come
among

that
ye
shall
awake
to
a
sense
of

upon

for
it

wherefore
I
moroni
am

that
the

may
come
that

chapter

and
now
I
moroni
proceed
with
my
record

therefore
beholdit
came
to
pass
that
because
of
the
secret
combinations
of
akishand
his
friends
behold
they
did
overthrow
the
kingdom
of
omerether


nevertheless
the
lord
was
merciful
unto
omer
and
also
to
hissons
and
to
his
daughters
who
did
not
seek
his
destructionether


and
the
lord
warned
omer
in
a
dream
that
he
should
depart
outof
the
land
wherefore
omer
departed
out
of
the
land
with
hisfamily
and
traveled
many
days
and
came
over
and
passed
by
thehill
of
shim
and
came
over
by
the
place
where
the
nephites
weredestroyed
and
from
thence
eastward
and
came
to
a
place
whichwas
called
ablom
by
the
seashore
and
there
he
pitched
his
tentand
also
his
sons
and
his
daughters
and
all
his
household
saveit
were
jared
and
his
familyether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
jared
was
anointed
king
over
thepeople
by
the
hand
of
wickedness
and
he
gave
unto
akish
hisdaughter
to
wifeether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
akish
sought
the
life
of
hisfatherinlaw
and
he
applied
unto
those
whom
he
had
sworn
by
theoath
of
the
ancients
and
they
obtained
the
head
of
hisfatherinlaw
as
he
sat
upon
his
throne
giving
audience
to
hispeopleether


for
so
great
had
been
the
spreading
of
this
wicked
and
secretsociety
that
it
had
corrupted
the
hearts
of
all
the
peopletherefore
jared
was
murdered
upon
his
throne
and
akish
reignedin
his
steadether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
akish
began
to
be
jealous
of
his
sontherefore
he
shut
him
up
in
prison
and
kept
him
upon
little

now
the

sorrow

and
it
came
topass
that
emer
did
reign
in
his
stead
and
did
fill
the
steps
ofhis
fatherether


and
the
lord
began
again
to
take
the
curse
from

landand
the
house
of
emer
did
prosper
exceedingly
under

there
was

allthis
came
to

and
the

moron
did
that
which

and
it
came
to

that
there
arose
a
rebellion
among

because
of
that
secret
combination
which

built
up
toget

and
it
came

and
it
came
to

that

and
in

there
also
came
many
prophetsand
prophesied
of

that

after
the
manner
bywhich
he

and
they
did
reject

oftheir
secret

and
it
came
to

and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
days
of
ether
were
in
the
days
ofcoriantumr
and
coriantumr
was
king
over
all
the
landether


and
ether
was
a
prophet
of
the
lord
wherefore
ether
cameforth
in
the
days
of
coriantumr
and
began
to
prophesy
unto
thepeople
for
he
could
not
be
restrained
because
of
the
spirit
ofthe
lord
which
was
in
himether


for
he
did
cry
from
the
morning
even
until
the
going
down
ofthe
sun
exhorting
the
people
to
believe
in
god
unto
repentancelest
they
should
be
destroyed
saying
unto
them
that
by
faith
allthings
are
fulfilledether


wherefore
whoso
believeth
in
god
might
with
surety
hope
for
abetter
world
yea
even
a
place
at
the
right
hand
of
god
whichhope
cometh
of
faith
maketh
an
anchor
to
the
souls
of
men
whichwould
make
them
sure
and
steadfast
always
abounding
in
goodworks
being
led
to
glorify
godether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
ether
did
prophesy
great
andmarvelous
things
unto
the
people
which
they
did
not
believebecause
they
saw
them
notether


and
now
I
moroni
would
speak
somewhat
concerning
thesethings
I
would
show
unto
the
world
that
faith
is
things
whichare
hoped
for
and
not
seen
wherefore
dispute
not
because
ye
seenot
for
ye
receive
no
witness
until
after
the
trial
of
yourfaithether


for
it
was
by
faith
that
christ
showed
himself
unto
ourfathers
after
he
had
risen
from
the
dead
and
he
showed
nothimself
unto
them
until
after
they
had
faith
in
him
whereforeit
must
needs
be
that
some
had
faith
in
him
for
he
showedhimself
not
unto
the
worldether


but
because
of
the
faith
of
men
he
has
shown
himself
unto
theworld
and
glorified
the
name
of
the
father
and
prepared
a
waythat
thereby
others
might
be
partakers
of
the
heavenly
gift
thatthey
might
hope
for
those
things
which
they
have
not
seenether


wherefore
ye
may
also
have
hope
and
be
partakers
of
thegift
if
ye
will
but
have
faithether


behold
it
was
by
faith
that
they
of
old
were
called
after
theholy
order
of
godether


wherefore
by
faith
was
the
law
of
moses
given

but
in
thegift
of
his
son
hath
god
prepared
a
more
excellent
way
and
it
isby
faith
that
it
hath
been
fulfilledether


for
if
there
be
no
faith
among
the
children
of
men
god
can
dono
miracle
among
them
wherefore
he
showed
not
himself
untilafter
their
faithether


behold
it
was
the
faith
of
alma
and
amulek
that
caused
theprison
to
tumble
to
the
earthether


behold
it
was
the
faith
of
nephi
and
lehi
that
wrought
thechange
upon
the
lamanites
that
they
were
baptized
with
fire
andwith
the
holy
ghostether


behold
it
was
the
faith
of
ammon
and
his
brethren
whichwrought
so
great
a
miracle
among
the
lamanitesether


yea
and
even
all
they
who
wrought
miracles
wrought
them
byfaith
even
those
who
were
before
christ
and
also
those
who
wereafterether


and
it
was
by
faith
that
the
three
disciples
obtained
apromise
that
they
should
not
taste
of
death
and
they
obtainednot
the
promise
until
after
their
faithether


and
neither
at
any
time
hath
any
wrought
miracles
until
aftertheir
faith
wherefore
they
first
believed
in
the
son
of
godether


and
there
were
many
whose
faith
was
so
exceedingly
strongeven
before
christ
came
who
could
not
be
kept
from
within
theveil
but
truly
saw
with
their
eyes
the
things
which
they
hadbeheld
with
an
eye
of
faith
and
they
were
gladether


and
behold
we
have
seen
in
this
record
that
one
of
these
wasthe
brother
of
jared
for
so
great
was
his
faith
in
god
thatwhen
god
put
forth
his
finger
he
could
not
hide
it
from
the
sightof
the
brother
of
jared
because
of
his
word
which
he
had
spokenunto
him
which
word
he
had
obtained
by
faithether


and
after
the
brother
of
jared
had
beheld
the
finger
of
thelord
because
of
the
promise
which
the
brother
of
jared
hadobtained
by
faith
the
lord
could
not
withhold
anything
from
hissight
wherefore
he
showed
him
all
things
for
he
could
no
longerbe
kept
without
the
veilether


and
it
is
by
faith
that
my
fathers
have
obtained
the
promisethat
these
things
should
come
unto
their
brethren
through
thegentiles
therefore
the
lord
hath
commanded
me
yea
even
jesuschristether


and
I
said
unto
him
lord
the
gentiles
will
mock
at
thesethings
because
of
our
weakness
in
writing
for
lord
thou
hastmade
us
mighty
in
word
by
faith
but
thou
hast
not
made
us
mightyin
writing
for
thou
hast
made
all
this
people
that
they
couldspeak
much
because
of
the
holy
ghost
which
thou
hast
given
themether


and
thou
hast
made
us
that
we
could
write
but
little
becauseof
the
awkwardness
of
our
hands

behold
thou
hast
not
made
usmighty
in
writing
like
unto
the
brother
of
jared
for
thou
madesthim
that
the
things
which
he
wrote
were
mighty
even
as
thou
artunto
the
overpowering
of
man
to
read
themether


thou
hast
also
made
our
words
powerful
and
great
even
thatwe
cannot
write
them
wherefore
when
we
write
we
behold
ourweakness
and
stumble
because
of
the
placing
of
our
words
and
Ifear
lest
the
gentiles
shall
mock
at
our
wordsether


and
when
I
had
said
this
the
lord
spake
unto
me
sayingfools
mock
but
they
shall
mourn
and
my
grace
is
sufficient
forthe
meek
that
they
shall
take
no
advantage
of
your
weaknessether


and
if
men
come
unto
me
I
will
show
unto
them
their
weaknessI
give
unto
men
weakness
that
they
may
be
humble
and
my
grace
issufficient
for
all
men
that
humble
themselves
before
me
for
ifthey
humble
themselves
before
me
and
have
faith
in
me
then
willI
make
weak
things
become
strong
unto
themether


behold
I
will
show
unto
the
gentiles
their
weakness
and
Iwill
show
unto
them
that
faith
hope
and
charity
bringeth
untomethe
fountain
of
all
righteousnessether


and
I
moroni
having
heard
these
words
was
comforted
andsaid
o
lord
thy
righteous
will
be
done
for
I
know
that
thouworkest
unto
the
children
of
men
according
to
their
faithether


for
the
brother
of
jared
said
unto
the
mountain
zerinremoveand
it
was
removed

and
if
he
had
not
had
faith
it
wouldnot
have
moved
wherefore
thou
workest
after
men
have
faithether


for
thus
didst
thou
manifest
thyself
unto
thy
disciples
forafter
they
had
faith
and
did
speak
in
thy
name
thou
didst
showthyself
unto
them
in
great
powerether


and
I
also
remember
that
thou
hast
said
that
thou
hastprepared
a
house
for
man
yea
even
among
the
mansions
of
thyfather
in
which
man
might
have
a
more
excellent
hope
whereforeman
must
hope
or
he
cannot
receive
an
inheritance
in
the
placewhich
thou
hast
preparedether


and
again
I
remember
that
thou
hast
said
that
thou
hastloved
the
world
even
unto
the
laying
down
of
thy
life
for
theworld
that
thou
mightest
take
it
again
to
prepare
a
place
forthe
children
of
menether


and
now
I
know
that
this
love
which
thou
hast
had
for
thechildren
of
men
is
charity
wherefore
except
men
shall
havecharity
they
cannot
inherit
that
place
which
thou
hast
preparedin
the
mansions
of
thy
fatherether


wherefore
I
know
by
this
thing
which
thou
hast
said
that
ifthe
gentiles
have
not
charity
because
of
our
weakness
that
thouwilt
prove
them
and
take
away
their
talent
yea
even
that
whichthey
have
received
and
give
unto
them
who
shall
have
moreabundantlyether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
I
prayed
unto
the
lord
that
he
wouldgive
unto
the
gentiles
grace
that
they
might
have
charityether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lord
said
unto
me
If
they
havenot
charity
it
mattereth
not
unto
thee
thou
hast
been
faithfulwherefore
thy
garments
shall
be
made
clean

and
because
thouhast
seen
thy
weakness
thou
shalt
be
made
strong
even
unto
thesitting
down
in
the
place
which
I
have
prepared
in
the
mansionsof
my
fatherether


and
now
I
moroni
bid
farewell
unto
the
gentiles
yea
andalso
unto
my
brethren
whom
I
love
until
we
shall
meet
before
thejudgmentseat
of
christ
where
all
men
shall
know
that
mygarments
are
not
spotted
with
your
bloodether


and
then
shall
ye
know
that
I
have
seen
jesus
and
that
hehath
talked
with
me
face
to
face
and
that
he
told
me
in
plainhumility
even
as
a
man
telleth
another
in
mine
own
languageconcerning
these
thingsether


and
only
a
few
have
I
written
because
of
my
weakness
inwritingether


and
now
I
would
commend
you
to
seek
this
jesus
of
whom
theprophets
and
apostles
have
written
that
the
grace
of
god
thefather
and
also
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
the
holy
ghost
whichbeareth
record
of
them
may
be
and
abide
in
you
forever

amenether
chapter
ether


and
now
I
moroni
proceed
to
finish
my
record
concerning
thedestruction
of
the
people
of
whom
I
have
been
writingether


for
behold
they
rejected
all
the
words
of
ether
for
he
trulytold
them
of
all
things
from
the
beginning
of
man
and
thatafter
the
waters
had
receded
from
off
the
face
of
this
land
itbecame
a
choice
land
above
all
other
lands
a
chosen
land
of
thelord
wherefore
the
lord
would
have
that
all
men
should
serve
himwho
dwell
upon
the
face
thereofether


and
that
it
was
the
place
of
the
new
jerusalem
which
shouldcome
down
out
of
heaven
and
the
holy
sanctuary
of
the
lordether


behold
ether
saw
the
days
of
christ
and
he
spake
concerninga
new
jerusalem
upon
this
landether


and
he
spake
also
concerning
the
house
of
Israel
and
thejerusalem
from
whence
lehi
should
comeafter
it
should
bedestroyed
it
should
be
built
up
again
a
holy
city
unto
the
lordwherefore
it
could
not
be
a
new
jerusalem
for
it
had
been
in
atime
of
old
but
it
should
be
built
up
again
and
become
a
holycity
of
the
lord
and
it
should
be
built
unto
the
house
ofIsraelether


and
that
a
new
jerusalem
should
be
built
upon
this
land
untothe
remnant
of
the
seed
of
joseph
for
which
things
there
hasbeen
a
typeether


for
as
joseph
brought
his
father
down
into
the
land
of
egypteven
so
he
died
there
wherefore
the
lord
brought
a
remnant
ofthe
seed
of
joseph
out
of
the
land
of
jerusalem
that
he
might
bemerciful
unto
the
seed
of
joseph
that
they
should
perish
noteven
as
he
was
merciful
unto
the
father
of
joseph
that
he
shouldperish
notether


wherefore
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
joseph
shall
be
builtupon
this
land
and
it
shall
be
a
land
of
their
inheritance
andthey
shall
build
up
a
holy
city
unto
the
lord
like
unto
thejerusalem
of
old
and
they
shall
no
more
be
confounded
until
theend
come
when
the
earth
shall
pass
awayether


and
there
shall
be
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
and
theyshall
be
like
unto
the
old
save
the
old
have
passed
away
and
allthings
have
become
newether


and
then
cometh
the
new
jerusalem
and
blessed
are
they
whodwell
therein
for
it
is
they
whose
garments
are
white
throughthe
blood
of
the
lamb
and
they
are
they
who
are
numbered
amongthe
remnant
of
the
seed
of
joseph
who
were
of
the
house
ofIsraelether


and
then
also
cometh
the
jerusalem
of
old
and
theinhabitants
thereof
blessed
are
they
for
they
have
been
washedin
the
blood
of
the
lamb
and
they
are
they
who
were
scatteredand
gathered
in
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
and
from
thenorth
countries
and
are
partakers
of
the
fulfilling
of
thecovenant
which
god
made
with
their
father
abrahamether


and
when
these
things
come
bringeth
to
pass
the
scripturewhich
saith
there
are
they
who
were
first
who
shall
be
lastand
there
are
they
who
were
last
who
shall
be
firstether


and
I
was
about
to
write
more
but
I
am
forbidden
but
greatand
marvelous
were
the
prophecies
of
ether
but
they
esteemed
himas
naught
and
cast
him
out
and
he
hid
himself
in
the
cavity
ofa
rock
by
day
and
by
night
he
went
forth
viewing
the
thingswhich
should
come
upon
the
peopleether


and
as
he
dwelt
in
the
cavity
of
a
rock
he
made
the
remainderof
his
record
viewing
the
destructions
which
came
upon
thepeople
by
nightether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
that
same
year
in
which
he
wascast
out
from
among
the
people
there
began
to
be
a
great
waramong
the
people
for
there
were
many
who
rose
up
who
weremighty
men
and
sought
to
destroy
coriantumr
by
their
secretplans
of
wickedness
of
which
hath
been
spokenether


and
now
coriantumr
having
studied
himself
in
all
the
artsof
war
and
all
the
cunning
of
the
world
wherefore
he
gave
battleunto
them
who
sought
to
destroy
himether


but
he
repented
not
neither
his
fair
sons
nor
daughtersneither
the
fair
sons
and
daughters
of
cohor
neither
the
fairsons
and
daughters
of

and
in
fine
there
were
none
ofthe
fair
sons
and
daughters
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
whorepented
of
their
sinsether


wherefore
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
first
year
that
etherdwelt
in
the
cavity
of
a
rock
there
were
many
people
who
wereslain
by
the
sword
of
those
secret
combinations
fighting
againstcoriantumr
that
they
might
obtain
the
kingdomether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
sons
of
coriantumr
fought
muchand
bled
muchether


and
in
the
second
year
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
etherthat
he
should
go
and
prophesy
unto
coriantumr
that
if
he
wouldrepent
and
all
his
household
the
lord
would
give
unto
him
hiskingdom
and
spare
the
peopleether


otherwise
they
should
be
destroyed
and
all
his
householdsave
it
were
himself

and
he
should
only
live
to
see
thefulfilling
of
the
prophecies
which
had
been
spoken
concerninganother
people
receiving
the
land
for
their
inheritance
andcoriantumr
should
receive
a
burial
by
them
and
every
soul
shouldbe
destroyed
save
it
were
coriantumrether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
repented
not
neither
hishousehold
neither
the
people
and
the
wars
ceased
not
and
theysought
to
kill
ether
but
he
fled
from
before
them
and
hid
againin
the
cavity
of
the
rockether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
up
shared
and
he
alsogave
battle
unto
coriantumr
and
he
did
beat
him
insomuch
thatin
the
third
year
he
did
bring
him
into
captivityether


and
the
sons
of
coriantumr
in
the
fourth
year
did
beatshared
and
did
obtain
the
kingdom
again
unto
their
fatherether


now
there
began
to
be
a
war
upon
all
the
face
of
the
landevery
man
with
his
band
fighting
for
that
which
he
desiredether


and
there
were
robbers
and
in
fine
all
manner
of
wickednessupon
all
the
face
of
the
landether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
was
exceedingly
angrywith
shared
and
he
went
against
him
with
his
armies
to
battleand
they
did
meet
in
great
anger
and
they
did
meet
in
the
valleyof
gilgal
and
the
battle
became
exceedingly
soreether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
shared
fought
against
him
for
thespace
of
three
days

and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
beathim
and
did
pursue
him
until
he
came
to
the
plains
of
heshlonether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
shared
gave
him
battle
again
uponthe
plains
and
behold
he
did
beat
coriantumr
and
drove
himback
again
to
the
valley
of
gilgalether


and
coriantumr
gave
shared
battle
again
in
the
valley
ofgilgal
in
which
he
beat
shared
and
slew
himether


and
shared
wounded
coriantumr
in
his
thigh
that
he
did
notgo
to
battle
again
for
the
space
of
two
years
in
which
time
allthe
people
upon
the
face
of
the
land
were
shedding
blood
andthere
was
none
to
restrain
themether
chapter
ether


and
now
there
began
to
be
a
great
curse
upon
all
the
landbecause
of
the
iniquity
of
the
people
in
which
if
a
man
shouldlay
his
tool
or
his
sword
upon
his
shelf
or
upon
the
placewhither
he
would
keep
it
behold
upon
the
morrow
he
could
notfind
it
so
great
was
the
curse
upon
the
landether


wherefore
every
man
did
cleave
unto
that
which
was
his
ownwith
his
hands
and
would
not
borrow
neither
would
he
lend
andevery
man
kept
the
hilt
of
his
sword
in
his
right
hand
in
thedefence
of
his
property
and
his
own
life
and
of
his
wives
andchildrenether


and
now
after
the
space
of
two
years
and
after
the
death
ofshared
behold
there
arose
the
brother
of
shared
and
he
gavebattle
unto
coriantumr
in
which
coriantumr
did
beat
him
and
didpursue
him
to
the
wilderness
of
akishether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
shared
did
give
battleunto
him
in
the
wilderness
of
akish
and
the
battle
becameexceedingly
sore
and
many
thousands
fell
by
the
swordether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
did
lay
siege
to
thewilderness
and
the
brother
of
shared
did
march
forth
out
of
thewilderness
by
night
and
slew
a
part
of
the
army
of
coriantumras
they
were
drunkenether


and
he
came
forth
to
the
land
of
moron
and
placed
himselfupon
the
throne
of
coriantumrether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
dwelt
with
his
army
in
thewilderness
for
the
space
of
two
years
in
which
he
did
receivegreat
strength
to
his
armyether


now
the
brother
of
shared
whose
name
was
gilead
alsoreceived
great
strength
to
his
army
because
of
secretcombinationsether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
his
high
priest
murdered
him
as
hesat
upon
his
throneether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
one
of
the
secret
combinationsmurdered
him
in
a
secret
pass
and
obtained
unto
himself
thekingdom
and
his
name
was
lib
and
lib
was
a
man
of
greatstature
more
than
any
other
man
among
all
the
peopleether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
first
year
of
lib
coriantumrcame
up
unto
the
land
of
moron
and
gave
battle
unto
libether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
fought
with
lib
in
which
lib
didsmite
upon
his
arm
that
he
was
wounded
nevertheless
the
army
ofcoriantumr
did
press
forward
upon
lib
that
he
fled
to
theborders
upon
the
seashoreether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
pursued
him
and
lib
gavebattle
unto
him
upon
the
seashoreether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
lib
did
smite
the
army
ofcoriantumr
that
they
fled
again
to
the
wilderness
of
akishether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
lib
did
pursue
him
until
he
came
tothe
plains
of
agosh

and
coriantumr
had
taken
all
the
peoplewith
him
as
he
fled
before
lib
in
that
quarter
of
the
landwhither
he
fledether


and
when
he
had
come
to
the
plains
of
agosh
he
gave
battleunto
lib
and
he
smote
upon
him
until
he
died
nevertheless
thebrother
of
lib
did
come
against
coriantumr
in
the
stead
thereofand
the
battle
became
exceedingly
sore
in
the
which
coriantumrfled
again
before
the
army
of
the
brother
of
libether


now
the
name
of
the
brother
of
lib
was
called
shiz

and
itcame
to
pass
that
shiz
pursued
after
coriantumr
and
he
didoverthrow
many
cities
and
he
did
slay
both
women
and
childrenand
he
did
burn
the
citiesether


and
there
went
a
fear
of
shiz
throughout
all
the
land
yea
acry
went
forth
throughout
the
landwho
can
stand
before
the
armyof
shiz

behold
he
sweepeth
the
earth
before
himether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
began
to
flock
togetherin
armies
throughout
all
the
face
of
the
landether


and
they
were
divided
and
a
part
of
them
fled
to
the
army
ofshiz
and
a
part
of
them
fled
to
the
army
of
coriantumrether


and
so
great
and
lasting
had
been
the
war
and
so
long
hadbeen
the
scene
of
bloodshed
and
carnage
that
the
whole
face
ofthe
land
was
covered
with
the
bodies
of
the
deadether


and
so
swift
and
speedy
was
the
war
that
there
was
none
leftto
bury
the
dead
but
they
did
march
forth
from
the
shedding
ofblood
to
the
shedding
of
blood
leaving
the
bodies
of
both
menwomen
and
children
strewed
upon
the
face
of
the
land
to
becomea
prey
to
the
worms
of
the
fleshether


and
the
scent
thereof
went
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
landeven
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
wherefore
the
people
becametroubled
by
day
and
by
night
because
of
the
scent
thereofether


nevertheless
shiz
did
not
cease
to
pursue
coriantumr
for
hehad
sworn
to
avenge
himself
upon
coriantumr
of
the
blood
of
hisbrother
who
had
been
slain
and
the
word
of
the
lord
which
cameto
ether
that
coriantumr
should
not
fall
by
the
swordether


and
thus
we
see
that
the
lord
did
visit
them
in
the
fulnessof
his
wrath
and
their
wickedness
and
abominations
had
prepareda
way
for
their
everlasting
destructionether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
shiz
did
pursue
coriantumr
eastwardeven
to
the
borders
by
the
seashore
and
there
he
gave
battleunto
shiz
for
the
space
of
three
daysether


and
so
terrible
was
the
destruction
among
the
armies
of
shizthat
the
people
began
to
be
frightened
and
began
to
flee
beforethe
armies
of
coriantumr
and
they
fled
to
the
land
of
corihorand
swept
off
the
inhabitants
before
them
all
them
that
wouldnot
join
themether


and
they
pitched
their
tents
in
the
valley
of
corihor
andcoriantumr
pitched
his
tents
in
the
valley
of
shurr

now
thevalley
of
shurr
was
near
the
hill
comnor
wherefore
coriantumrdid
gather
his
armies
together
upon
the
hill
comnor
and
didsound
a
trumpet
unto
the
armies
of
shiz
to
invite
them
forth
tobattleether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
forth
but
were
drivenagain
and
they
came
the
second
time
and
they
were
driven
againthe
second
time

and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
again
thethird
time
and
the
battle
became
exceedingly
soreether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
shiz
smote
upon
coriantumr
that
hegave
him
many
deep
wounds
and
coriantumr
having
lost
his
bloodfainted
and
was
carried
away
as
though
he
were
deadether


now
the
loss
of
men
women
and
children
on
both
sides
was
sogreat
that
shiz
commanded
his
people
that
they
should
not
pursuethe
armies
of
coriantumr
wherefore
they
returned
to
their
campether
chapter
ether


and
it
came
to
pass
when
coriantumr
had
recovered
of
hiswounds
he
began
to
remember
the
words
which
ether
had
spokenunto
himether


he
saw
that
there
had
been
slain
by
the
sword
already
nearlytwo
millions
of
his
people
and
he
began
to
sorrow
in
his
heartyea
there
had
been
slain
two
millions
of
mighty
men
and
alsotheir
wives
and
their
childrenether


he
began
to
repent
of
the
evil
which
he
had
done
he
began
toremember
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
theprophets
and
he
saw
them
that
they
were
fulfilled
thus
farevery
whit
and
his
soul
mourned
and
refused
to
be
comfortedether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
wrote
an
epistle
unto
shizdesiring
him
that
he
would
spare
the
people
and
he
would
give
upthe
kingdom
for
the
sake
of
the
lives
of
the
peopleether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
shiz
had
received
his
epistle
hewrote
an
epistle
unto
coriantumr
that
if
he
would
give
himselfup
that
he
might
slay
him
with
his
own
sword
that
he
wouldspare
the
lives
of
the
peopleether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
repented
not
of
theiriniquity
and
the
people
of
coriantumr
were
stirred
up
to
angeragainst
the
people
of
shiz
and
the
people
of
shiz
were
stirredup
to
anger
against
the
people
of
coriantumr
wherefore
thepeople
of
shiz
did
give
battle
unto
the
people
of
coriantumrether


and
when
coriantumr
saw
that
he
was
about
to
fall
he
fledagain
before
the
people
of
shizether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
he
came
to
the
waters
of
ripliancumwhich
by
interpretation
is
large
or
to
exceed
all
whereforewhen
they
came
to
these
waters
they
pitched
their
tents
and
shizalso
pitched
his
tents
near
unto
them
and
therefore
on
themorrow
they
did
come
to
battleether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fought
an
exceedingly
sorebattle
in
which
coriantumr
was
wounded
again
and
he
faintedwith
the
loss
of
bloodether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
coriantumr
did
pressupon
the
armies
of
shiz
that
they
beat
them
that
they
causedthem
to
flee
before
them
and
they
did
flee
southward
and
didpitch
their
tents
in
a
place
which
was
called
ogathether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
army
of
coriantumr
did
pitchtheir
tents
by
the
hill
ramah
and
it
was
that
same
hill
where
myfather
mormon
did
hide
up
the
records
unto
the
lord
which
weresacredether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
gather
together
all
thepeople
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
who
had
not
been
slainsave
it
was
etherether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
ether
did
behold
all
the
doings
ofthe
people
and
he
beheld
that
the
people
who
were
for
coriantumrwere
gathered
together
to
the
army
of
coriantumr
and
the
peoplewho
were
for
shiz
were
gathered
together
to
the
army
of
shizether


wherefore
they
were
for
the
space
of
four
years
gatheringtogether
the
people
that
they
might
get
all
who
were
upon
theface
of
the
land
and
that
they
might
receive
all
the
strengthwhich
it
was
possible
that
they
could
receiveether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
were
all
gatheredtogether
every
one
to
the
army
which
he
would
with
their
wivesand
their
childrenboth

after
the
manner
of

didmarch
forth
one
against

to
battle
and
they
fought
allthat
day
and
conquered
notether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
it
was
night
they
were
wearyand
retired
to
their
camps
and
after
they
had
retired
to
theircamps
they
took
up
a
howling
and
a
lamentation
for
the
loss
ofthe
slain
of
their
people
and
so
great
were
their
cries
theirhowlings
and
lamentations
that
they
did
rend
the
airexceedinglyether


and
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the

they
did
go
again
tobattle
and
great
and
terrible
was
that
day
nevertheless
theyconquered

when

rend

with
their

and
their
howlings
and
their
mourningsfor
the
loss
of
the
slain
of

and
it
came
to
pass
that
coriantumr
wrote
again
an
epistleunto
shiz
desiring
that
he
would
not
come
again
to
battle
butthat
he
would
take
the
kingdom
and
spare
the
lives
of

and
behold
the
spirit
of
the
lord
had
ceased
striving
withthem
and
satan
had
full
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
people
forthey
were
given
up
unto
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
theblindness
of
their
minds
that
they
might
be
destroyed
whereforethey

and
it
came
to

and
on

and
now
I
speak
concerning
baptism

behold
elders
priestsand
teachers
were
baptized
and
they
were
not
baptized
save
theybrought
forth
fruit
meet
that
they
were
worthy
of
itmoroni


neither
did
they
receive
any
unto
baptism
save
they
came
forthwith
a
broken
heart
and
a
contrite
spirit
and
witnessed
unto
thechurch
that
they
truly
repented
of
all
their
sinsmoroni


and
none
were
received
unto
baptism
save
they
took
upon
themthe
name
of
christ
having
a
determination
to
serve
him
to
theendmoroni


and
after
they
had
been
received
unto
baptism
and
werewrought
upon
and
cleansed
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
theywere
numbered
among
the
people
of
the
church
of
christ
and
theirnames
were
taken
that
they
might
be
remembered
and
nourished
bythe
good
word
of
god
to
keep
them
in
the
right
way
to
keep
themcontinually
watchful
unto
prayer
relying
alone
upon
the
meritsof
christ
who
was
the
author
and
the
finisher
of
their
faithmoroni


and
the
church
did
meet
together
oft
to
fast
and
to
pray
andto
speak
one
with
another
concerning
the
welfare
of
their
soulsmoroni


and
they
did
meet
together
oft
to
partake
of
bread
and
winein
remembrance
of
the
lord
jesusmoroni


and
they
were
strict
to
observe
that
there
should
be
noiniquity
among
them
and
whoso
was
found
to
commit
iniquity
andthree
witnesses
of
the
church
did
condemn
them
before
the
eldersand
if
they
repented
not
and
confessed
not
their
names
wereblotted
out
and
they
were
not
numbered
among
the
people
ofchristmoroni


but
as
oft
as
they
repented
and
sought
forgiveness
with
realintent
they
were
forgivenmoroni


and
their
meetings
were
conducted
by
the
church
after
themanner
of
the
workings
of
the
spirit
and
by
the
power
of
theholy
ghost
for
as
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
led
them
whetherto
preach
or
to
exhort
or
to
pray
or
to
supplicate
or

even
so
it
was
donemoroni
chapter

and
now
I
moroni
write
a
few
of
the
words
of
my
fathermormon
which
he
spake
concerning
faith
hope
and
charity
forafter
this
manner
did
he
speak
unto
the
people
as
he
taught
themin
the
synagogue
which
they
had
built
for
the
place
of
worshipmoroni


and
now
I
mormon
speak
unto
you
my
beloved
brethren
and
itis
by
the
grace
of
god
the
father
and
our
lord
jesus
christ
andhis
holy
will
because
of
the
gift
of
his
calling
unto
me
that
Iam
permitted
to
speak
unto
you
at
this
timemoroni


wherefore
I
would
speak
unto
you
that
are
of
the
church
thatare
the
peaceable
followers
of
christ
and
that
have
obtained
asufficient
hope
by
which
ye
can
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
lordfrom
this
time
henceforth
until
ye
shall
rest
with
him
in
heavenmoroni


and
now
my
brethren
I
judge
these
things
of
you
because
ofyour
peaceable
walk
with
the
children
of
menmoroni


for
I
remember
the
word
of
god
which
saith
by
their
works
yeshall
know
them
for
if
their
works
be
good
then
they
are
goodalsomoroni


for
behold
god
hath
said
a
man
being
evil
cannot
do
thatwhich
is
good
for
if
he
offereth
a
gift
or
prayeth
unto
godexcept
he
shall
do
it
with
real
intent
it
profiteth
him
nothingmoroni


for
behold
it
is
not
counted
unto
him
for
righteousnessmoroni


for
behold
if
a
man
being
evil
giveth
a
gift
he
doeth
itgrudgingly
wherefore
it
is
counted
unto
him
the
same
as
if
hehad
retained
the
gift
wherefore
he
is
counted
evil
before
godmoroni


and
likewise
also
is
it
counted
evil
unto
a
man
if
he
shallpray
and
not
with
real
intent
of
heart
yea
and
it
profiteth
himnothing
for
god
receiveth
none
suchmoroni


wherefore
a
man
being
evil
cannot
do
that
which
is
goodneither
will
he
give
a
good
giftmoroni


for
behold
a
bitter
fountain
cannot
bring
forth
good
waterneither
can
a
good
fountain
bring
forth
bitter
water
whereforea
man
being
a
servant
of
the
devil
cannot
follow
christ
and
ifhe
follow
christ
he
cannot
be
a
servant
of
the
devilmoroni


wherefore
all
things
which
are
good
cometh
of
god
and
thatwhich
is
evil
cometh
of
the
devil
for
the
devil
is
an
enemy
untogod
and
fighteth
against
him
continually
and
inviteth
andenticeth
to
sin
and
to
do
that
which
is
evil
continuallymoroni


but
behold
that
which
is
of
god
inviteth
and
enticeth
to
dogood
continually
wherefore
every
thing
which
inviteth
andenticeth
to
do
good
and
to
love
god
and
to
serve
him
isinspired
of
godmoroni


wherefore
take
heed
my
beloved
brethren
that
ye
do
notjudge
that
which
is
evil
to
be
of
god
or
that
which
is
good
andof
god
to
be
of
the
devilmoroni


for
behold
my
brethren
it
is
given
unto
you
to
judge
thatye
may
know
good
from
evil
and
the
way
to
judge
is
as
plainthat
ye
may
know
with
a
perfect
knowledge
as
the
daylight
isfrom
the
dark
nightmoroni


for
behold
the
spirit
of
christ
is
given
to
every
man
thathe
may
know
good
from
evil
wherefore
I
show
unto
you
the
way
tojudge
for
every
thing
which
inviteth
to
do
good
and
to
persuadeto
believe
in
christ
is
sent
forth
by
the
power
and
gift
ofchrist
wherefore
ye
may
know
with
a
perfect
knowledge
it
is
ofgodmoroni


but
whatsoever
thing
persuadeth
men
to
do
evil
and
believenot
in
christ
and
deny
him
and
serve
not
god
then
ye
may
knowwith
a
perfect
knowledge
it
is
of
the
devil
for
after
thismanner
doth
the
devil
work
for
he
persuadeth
no
man
to
do
goodno
not
one
neither
do
his
angels
neither
do
they
who
subjectthemselves
unto
himmoroni


and
now
my
brethren
seeing
that
ye
know
the
light
by
whichye
may
judge
which
light
is
the
light
of
christ
see
that
ye
donot
judge
wrongfully
for
with
that
same
judgment
which
ye
judgeye
shall
also
be
judgedmoroni


wherefore
I
beseech
of
you
brethren
that
ye
should
searchdiligently
in
the
light
of
christ
that
ye
may
know
good
fromevil
and
if
ye
will
lay
hold
upon
every
good
thing
and
condemnit
not
ye
certainly
will
be
a
child
of
christmoroni


and
now
my
brethren
how
is
it
possible
that
ye
can
lay
holdupon
every
good
thingmoroni


and
now
I
come
to
that
faith
of
which
I
said
I
would
speakand
I
will
tell
you
the
way
whereby
ye
may
lay
hold
on
every
goodthingmoroni


for
behold
god
knowing
all
things
being
from
everlasting
toeverlasting
behold
he
sent
angels
to
minister
unto
the
childrenof
men
to
make
manifest
concerning
the
coming
of
christ
and
inchrist
there
should
come
every
good
thingmoroni


and
god
also
declared
unto
prophets
by
his
own
mouth
thatchrist
should
comemoroni


and
behold
there
were
divers
ways
that
he
did
manifestthings
unto
the
children
of
men
which
were
good
and
all
thingswhich
are
good
cometh
of
christ
otherwise
men
were
fallen
andthere
could
no
good
thing
come
unto
themmoroni


wherefore
by
the
ministering
of
angels
and
by
every
wordwhich
proceeded
forth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
men
began
toexercise
faith
in
christ
and
thus
by
faith
they
did
lay
holdupon
every
good
thing
and
thus
it
was
until
the
coming
ofchristmoroni


and
after
that
he
came
men
also
were
saved
by
faith
in
hisname
and
by
faith
they
become
the
sons
of
god

and
as
sure
aschrist
liveth
he
spake
these
words
unto
our
fathers
sayingwhatsoever
thing
ye
shall
ask
the
father
in
my
name
which
isgood
in
faith
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
behold
it
shallbe
done
unto
youmoroni


wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
have
miracles
ceased
becausechrist
hath
ascended
into
heaven
and
hath
sat
down
on
the
righthand
of
god
to
claim
of
the
father
his
rights
of
mercy
which
hehath
upon
the
children
of
menmoroni


for
he
hath
answered
the
ends
of
the
law
and
he
claimeth
allthose
who
have
faith
in
him
and
they
who
have
faith
in
him
willcleave
unto
every
good
thing
wherefore
he
advocateth
the
causeof
the
children
of
men
and
he
dwelleth
eternally
in
the
heavensmoroni


and
because
he
hath
done
this
my
beloved
brethren
havemiracles
ceased

behold
I
say
unto
you
nay
neither
have
angelsceased
to
minister
unto
the
children
of
menmoroni


for
behold
they
are
subject
unto
him
to
minister
accordingto
the
word
of
his
command
showing
themselves
unto
them
ofstrong
faith
and
a
firm
mind
in
every
form
of
godlinessmoroni


and
the
office
of
their
ministry
is
to
call
men
untorepentance
and
to
fulfill
and
to
do
the
work
of
the
covenants
ofthe
father
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
children
of
men
toprepare
the
way
among
the
children
of
men
by
declaring
the
wordof
christ
unto
the
chosen
vessels
of
the
lord
that
they
may
beartestimony
of
himmoroni


and
by
so
doing
the
lord
god
prepareth
the
way
that
theresidue
of
men
may
have
faith
in
christ
that
the
holy
ghost
mayhave
place
in
their
hearts
according
to
the
power
thereof
andafter
this
manner
bringeth
to
pass
the
father
the
covenantswhich
he
hath
made
unto
the
children
of
menmoroni


and
christ
hath
said
If
ye
will
have
faith
in
me
ye
shallhave
power
to
do
whatsoever
thing
is
expedient
in
memoroni


and
he
hath
said
repent
all
ye
ends
of
the
earth
and
comeunto
me
and
be
baptized
in
my
name
and
have
faith
in
me
thatye
may
be
savedmoroni


and
now
my
beloved
brethren
if
this
be
the
case
that
thesethings
are
true
which
I
have
spoken
unto
you
and
god
will
showunto
you
with
power
and
great
glory
at
the
last
day
that
theyare
true
and
if
they
are
true
has
the
day
of
miracles
ceasedmoroni


or
have
angels
ceased
to
appear
unto
the
children
of
men

orhas
he
withheld
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
from
them

or
willhe
so
long
as
time
shall
last
or
the
earth
shall
stand
orthere
shall
be
one
man
upon
the
face
thereof
to
be
savedmoroni


behold
I
say
unto
you
nay
for
it
is
by
faith
that
miraclesare
wrought
and
it
is
by
faith
that
angels
appear
and
ministerunto
men
wherefore
if
these
things
have
ceased
wo
be
unto
thechildren
of
men
for
it
is
because
of
unbelief
and
all
is
vainmoroni


for
no
man
can
be
saved
according
to
the
words
of
christsave
they
shall
have
faith
in
his
name
wherefore
if
thesethings
have
ceased
then
has
faith
ceased
also
and
awful
is
thestate
of
man
for
they
are
as
though
there
had
been
no
redemptionmademoroni


but
behold
my
beloved
brethren
I
judge
better
things
ofyou
for
I
judge
that
ye
have
faith
in
christ
because
of
yourmeekness
for
if
ye
have
not
faith
in
him
then
ye
are
not
fit
tobe
numbered
among
the
people
of
his
churchmoroni


and
again
my
beloved
brethren
I
would
speak
unto
youconcerning
hope

how
is
it
that
ye
can
attain
unto
faith
saveye
shall
have
hopemoroni


and
what
is
it
that
ye
shall
hope
for

behold
I
say
unto
youthat
ye
shall
have
hope
through
the
atonement
of
christ
and
thepower
of
his
resurrection
to
be
raised
unto
life
eternal
andthis
because
of
your
faith
in
him
according
to
the
promisemoroni


wherefore
if
a
man
have
faith
he
must
needs
have
hope
forwithout
faith
there
cannot
be
any
hopemoroni


and
again
behold
I
say
unto
you
that
he
cannot
have
faithand
hope
save
he
shall
be
meek
and
lowly
of
heartmoroni


If
so
his
faith
and
hope
is
vain
for
none
is
acceptablebefore
god
save
the
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
and
if
a
man
bemeek
and
lowly
in
heart
and
confesses
by
the
power
of
the
holyghost
that
jesus
is
the
christ
he
must
needs
have
charity
forif
he
have
not
charity
he
is
nothing
wherefore
he
must
needshave
charitymoroni


and
charity
suffereth
long
and
is
kind
and
envieth

not

rejoiceth
inthe
truth

wherefore
my
beloved
brethren
if
ye

yeare
nothing
for
charity
never
faileth

wherefore
cleave
untocharity
which
is
the

an
epistle
of
my
father
mormon
written
to
me
moroni
and
itwas
written
unto
me
soon
after
my
calling
to
the
ministry

andon
this
wise
did
he
write
unto
me
sayingmoroni


my
beloved
son
moroni
I
rejoice
exceedingly
that
your
lordjesus
christ
hath
been
mindful
of
you
and
hath
called
you
to
hisministry
and
to
his
holy
workmoroni


I
am
mindful
of
you
always
in
my
prayers
continually
prayingunto
god
the
father
in
the
name
of
his
holy
child
jesus
thathe
through
his
infinite
goodness
and
grace
will
keep
youthrough
the
endurance
of
faith
on
his
name
to
the
endmoroni


and
now
my
son
I
speak
unto
you
concerning
that
whichgrieveth
me
exceedingly
for
it
grieveth
me
that
there
shoulddisputations
rise
among
youmoroni


for
if
I
have
learned
the
truth
there
have
been
disputationsamong
you
concerning
the
baptism
of
your
little
childrenmoroni


and
now
my
son
I
desire
that
ye
should
labor
diligentlythat
this
gross
error
should
be
removed
from
among
you
for
forthis
intent
I
have
written
this
epistlemoroni


for
immediately
after
I
had
learned
these
things
of
you
Iinquired
of
the
lord
concerning
the
matter

and
the
word
of
thelord
came
to
me
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
sayingmoroni


listen
to
the
words
of
christ
your
redeemer
your
lord
andyour
god

behold
I
came
into
the
world
not
to
call
therighteous
but
sinners
to
repentance
the
whole
need
no
physicianbut
they
that
are
sick
wherefore
little
children
are
whole
forthey
are
not
capable
of
committing
sin
wherefore
the
curse
ofadam
is
taken
from
them
in
me
that
it
hath
no
power
over
themand
the
law
of
circumcision
is
done
away
in
memoroni


and
after
this
manner
did
the
holy
ghost
manifest
the
word
ofgod
unto
me
wherefore
my
beloved
son
I
know
that
it
is
solemnmockery
before
god
that
ye
should
baptize
little
childrenmoroni


behold
I
say
unto
you
that
this
thing
shall
yeteachrepentance
and
baptism
unto
those
who
are
accountable
andcapable
of
committing
sin
yea
teach
parents
that
they
mustrepent
and
be
baptized
and
humble
themselves
as
their
littlechildren
and
they
shall
all
be
saved
with
their
little
childrenmoroni


and
their
little
children
need
no
repentance
neitherbaptism

behold
baptism
is
unto
repentance
to
the
fulfillingthe
commandments
unto
the
remission
of
sinsmoroni


but
little
children
are
alive
in
christ
even
from
thefoundation
of
the
world
if
not
so
god
is
a
partial
god
andalso
a
changeable
god
and
a
respecter
to
persons
for
how
manylittle
children
have
died
without
baptismmoroni


wherefore
if
little
children
could
not
be
saved
withoutbaptism
these
must
have
gone
to
an
endless
hellmoroni


behold
I
say
unto
you
that
he
that
supposeth
that
littlechildren
need
baptism
is
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
and
in
thebonds
of
iniquity
for
he
hath
neither
faith
hope
nor
charitywherefore
should
he
be
cut
off
while
in
the
thought
he
must
godown
to
hellmoroni


for
awful
is
the
wickedness
to
suppose
that
god
saveth
onechild
because
of
baptism
and
the
other
must
perish
because
hehath
no
baptismmoroni


wo
be
unto
them
that
shall
pervert
the
ways
of
the
lord
afterthis
manner
for
they
shall
perish
except
they
repent

behold
Ispeak
with
boldness
having
authority
from
god
and
I
fear
notwhat
man
can
do
for
perfect
love
casteth
out
all
fearmoroni


and
I
am
filled
with
charity
which
is
everlasting
lovewherefore
all
children
are
alike
unto
me
wherefore
I
lovelittle
children
with
a
perfect
love
and
they
are
all
alike
andpartakers
of
salvationmoroni


for
I
know
that
god
is
not
a
partial
god
neither
achangeable
being
but
he
is
unchangeable
from
all
eternity
to
alleternitymoroni


little
children
cannot
repent
wherefore
it
is
awfulwickedness
to
deny
the
pure
mercies
of
god
unto
them
for
theyare
all
alive
in
him
because
of
his
mercymoroni


and
he
that
saith
that
little
children
need
baptism
denieththe
mercies
of
christ
and
setteth
at
naught
the
atonement
of
himand
the
power
of
his
redemptionmoroni


wo
unto
such
for
they
are
in
danger
of
death
hell
and
anendless
torment

I
speak
it
boldly
god
hath
commanded
me
listen
unto
them
and
give
heed
or
they
stand
against
you
at
thejudgmentseat
of
christmoroni


for
behold
that
all
little
children
are
alive
in
christ
andalso
all
they
that
are
without
the
law

for
the
power
ofredemption
cometh
on
all
them
that
have
no
law
wherefore
hethat
is
not
condemned
or
he
that
is
under
no
condemnationcannot
repent
and
unto
such
baptism
availeth
nothingmoroni


but
it
is
mockery
before
god
denying
the
mercies
of
christand
the
power
of
his
holy
spirit
and
putting
trust
in
deadworksmoroni


behold
my
son
this
thing
ought
not
to
be
for
repentance
isunto
them
that
are
under
condemnation
and
under
the
curse
of
abroken
lawmoroni


and
the
first
fruits
of
repentance
is
baptism
and
baptismcometh
by
faith
unto
the
fulfilling
the
commandments
and
thefulfilling
the
commandments
bringeth
remission
of
sinsmoroni


and
the
remission
of
sins
bringeth
meekness
and
lowliness
ofheart
and
because
of
meekness
and
lowliness
of
heart
cometh
thevisitation
of
the
holy
ghost
which
comforter
filleth
with
hopeand
perfect
love
which
love
endureth
by
diligence
unto
prayeruntil
the
end
shall
come
when
all
the

behold
my

I
will
write
unto
you
again
if
I
go
not

against

lamanites

behold
the
pride
of
this
nation
orthe
people
of

nephites
hath
proven

destruction
exceptthey

pray
for
them
my
son
that
repentance
may
come
unto
them
but
behold
I
fear
lest
the
spirit
hath
ceased
striving
withthem
and
in
this
part
of
the

they
are
also
seeking
to
putdown
all

authority
which
cometh

and
after
rejecting

my

I
write
unto
you
again
that
ye
may
know
that
Iam
yet
alive
but
I
write
somewhat
of
that
which
is
grievousmoroni


for
behold
I
have
had
a
sore
battle
with
the
lamanites
inwhich
we
did
not
conquer
and
archeantus
has
fallen
by
the
swordand
also
luram
and
emron
yea
and
we
have
lost
a
great
number
ofour
choice
menmoroni


and
now
behold
my
son
I
fear
lest
the
lamanites
shalldestroy
this
people
for
they
do
not
repent
and
satan
stirreththem
up
continually
to
anger
one
with
anothermoroni


behold
I
am
laboring
with
them
continually
and
when
I
speakthe
word
of
god
with
sharpness
they
tremble
and
anger
against
meand
when
I
use
no
sharpness
they
harden
their
hearts
against
itwherefore
I
fear
lest
the
spirit
of
the
lord
hath
ceasedstriving
with

for
so
exceedingly
do
they
anger
that
it
seemeth
me
that
theyhave
no
fear
of
death
and
they
have
lost
their
love
one
towardsanother
and
they
thirst
after
blood
and
revenge
continuallymoroni


and
now
my
beloved
son
notwithstanding
their
hardness
letus
labor
diligently
for
if
we
should
cease
to
labor
we
shouldbe
brought
under
condemnation
for
we
have
a
labor
to
performwhilst
in

tabernacle
of

that
we
may
conquer
the
enemyof
all
righteousness
and
rest
our
souls
in
the
kingdom
of

and
now
I
write
somewhat
concerning
the
sufferings
of
thispeople

for
according
to
the
knowledge
which
I
have
receivedfrom

there

and
the
husbands
and
fathers
of
those
women
and

theyhave
slain
and
they
feed
the
women
upon

and
the
children
upon
the
flesh
of
their
fathers
andno
water
save
a

they
give
unto

and
notwithstanding
this
great
abomination
of
the
lamanitesit
doth
not
exceed
that
of
our
people
in
moriantum

for
beholdmany
of
the
daughters
of
the
lamanites
have
they
taken
prisonersand
after
depriving
them
of
that
which
was
most
dear
and
preciousabove
all
things
which
is
chastity
and
virtuemoroni


and
after
they
had
done
this
thing
they
did
murder
them
in
amost
cruel
manner
torturing
their
bodies
even
unto
death
andafter
they
have
done
this
they
devour
their
flesh
like
unto
wildbeasts
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
they
do
itfor
a
token
of
braverymoroni


o
my
beloved
son
how
can
a
people
like
this
that

and
only
a
few
years
have
passed

o

how
can
a
people

and
again
my

there
are
many
widows
and
their
daughterswho
remain
in
sherrizah
and
that
part
of
the
provisions
whichthe
lamanites
did
not
carry
away
behold
the
army
of
zenephi
hascarried
away
and
left
them
to
wander
whithersoever
they
can
forfood
and
many
old
women
do
faint
by
the
way
and
diemoroni


and
the
army
which
is
with
me
is
weak
and
the
armies
of
thelamanites
are
betwixt
sherrizah
and
me
and
as
many
as

fledto
the
army
of
aaron
have
fallen
victims
to
their
awfulbrutalitymoroni


o
the
depravity
of

knowest
the
wickedness

I
know
that

and
if
they
perish
it
will
be
